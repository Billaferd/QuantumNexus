# Quantum Nexus Ability Creation Guidelines

## Introduction

Abilities are used throughout Quantum Nexus, they are used as mission card abilities, unit abilities, event effects, even keyword effects.

Abilities are made up of several parts:

- Effects: Effects are the parts of the ability that do something. They change the state of the game in some way, removing a card, adding CP, dealing damage. Effects are required and have the largest effect on an abilities cost. Effects are also categorized into Beneficial or Detrimental. The categorization is based on a friendly target, if a detrimental effect targets an opponent, then the effect becomes beneficial.

- Targets: Each ability must have a target, That target can be literally anything in the game. Decks, Cards, Stats, these and more can all be targets in the game. The target is what an effect is applied to. Targets determine whether the ability is helpful or detrimental. if the effect is beneficial and it targets an opponent, then the ability would be a negative ability.

- Triggers: Triggers may be necessary for an ability for thematic or balancing reasons. Triggers make the ability harder to use by limiting the times that it can be used. Some triggers are active, requiring a player to make a conscious choice to activate it, or passive, meaning an ability would be triggered as long as the condition is met. Triggers have their own targets and condition. For instance, Pay 2 CP, Activate this card, and Discard a card are all active triggers. CP, 'this' card, and 'a' card are all the targets. Some passive triggers would be: When this unit is attacked, when an opposing unit is deployed, and when any card is exiled.

- Conditions: Conditions can be applied to make the effects, targets, and triggers more interesting and apply boolean logic to the ability. And, Or, Not, and Xor can all be used to add new depth.

### Conditionals

Conditionals allow for modifications to how the Effects, Targets, and Triggers operate by allowing them to be used in unison, or force a decision between them.

#### Common Conditionals

| Conditional  | Common Phrasing  | Description                                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                                      | Source(s)  |

| **If**       | If, When         | Checks for a specific state or event. The triggered ability only activates **if** this condition is met at the moment the trigger occurs.            | "**If** your CP is less than 5, draw a card." [previous response]                                                                                             |       |
| **When**     | When, Whenever   |  Indicates that the ability activates automatically **when** a specific event happens. This implies continuous activation whenever the trigger occurs. |  "**When** this unit enters a quadrant with a Terrain card, draw a card."                                                                                     |         |
| **During**  | During          | Specifies a particular phase of the game during which the ability can be activated.                                                                     | "**During** your Command Phase, you may discard a card to gain 2 CP."

| **After**    | After           | Triggers the ability **after** a specific action or event has been resolved.                                                                          | "**After** destroying an enemy unit, this unit gains +1 Attack." [previous response] **Note:** This assumes the game tracks previous actions, not confirmed by sources. |             |
| **Unless**  | Unless          |  Reverses the typical conditional logic. The ability activates **unless** the specified condition is met.                                         |  "Discard a card. **Unless** you do, lose 2 CP."

####  Boolean Operators for Complex Conditions

| Boolean Operator | Description                                                                                                                | Example                                                                                                                                                                   | Source(s) |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| **And**          | Both conditions connected by "And" must be true for the ability to activate.                                             | "When this unit is attacked **AND** your CP is greater than 5, you may discard a card to deal 3 damage to the attacker." [previous response]                                 |         |
| **Or**           | The ability activates if at least one of the conditions connected by "Or" is true.                                      |  "When a friendly unit is deployed **OR** an enemy unit is destroyed, gain 1 CP."  This example is not from the sources but illustrates the concept.                       |         |
| **Not**          | The ability activates only if the condition following "Not" is **false**.                                                 |  "Draw a card. **Not** if you have 5 or more cards in hand." This example is not from the sources but illustrates the concept.                                               |         |
| **Xor**          | (Exclusive Or) The ability activates if **exactly one** of the conditions connected by "Xor" is true, but not both.      | "**Xor**: If this unit is in the front row, it gains +2 Attack. If this unit is in the back row, it gains +2 Defense." This example is not from the sources, but illustrates the concept. |         | 

#### Key Points about Conditionals

* **Conditional Specificity:** Conditionals provide crucial context for triggers, defining the precise circumstances under which a triggered ability can activate.
* **Strategic Depth:**  The combination of triggers, conditions, and boolean operators allows for a wide array of complex and nuanced abilities.
* **Player Choice:** Some conditions, particularly those using "If" or "During," introduce elements of player choice, allowing strategic decisions about when to activate abilities. 
* **Impact on Balance:** The careful design of conditionals directly impacts the balance of cards and abilities, ensuring that powerful effects are appropriately gated.
