# Quantum Nexus Ability Creation Guidelines

 * Identify the Category and Effect in question.
 * Determine who the effect is being applied to:
   * If the effect benefits the player using the ability, use the Player Points value.
   * If the effect benefits the opponent, use the Opponent Points value.
 * Multiply the point value by the appropriate Variable if applicable.
   * For example, if the effect is "Drawing cards" and the player draws 3 cards, the cost would be +6 (+2 Player Points * 3 cards).
 * Use the calculated cost to balance the ability against other effects on the card or within the game.

Remember, this table is a starting point and may need adjustments based on playtesting and further refinement.
