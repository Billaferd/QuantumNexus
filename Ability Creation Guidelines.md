# Quantum Nexus Ability Creation Guidelines

## I. Introduction

Welcome to the Quantum Nexus Ability Creation Guidelines! This guide is your key to understanding and crafting the unique abilities that power the cards in the Quantum Nexus universe. Abilities are the driving force behind every action in the game, from the devastating attacks of your units to the subtle manipulations of events and the game-changing effects of your mission cards.

Think of abilities as the special moves or powers that your cards possess. They add a layer of strategic depth and tactical decision-making to every game, allowing you to outwit your opponents and achieve victory through cunning and skill. Whether you're designing a new unit with devastating attacks, an asset that provides ongoing support, or an event that disrupts your opponent's plans, understanding how to create and balance abilities is essential.

In Quantum Nexus, abilities are more than just simple actions; they are carefully crafted combinations of effects, targets, triggers, and conditions. By weaving these elements together, you can create a rich tapestry of strategic possibilities, ensuring that every card has a unique personality and impact on the game.
Here's a breakdown of the core components that make up an ability:

 * Effects: These are the actions that an ability performs, such as dealing damage, healing, or manipulating the battlefield. They are the "what happens" part of an ability.
 * Targets: Every ability needs a target, which is what the effect is applied to. Targets can be anything from a specific unit on the battlefield to a player's CP pool or even the battlefield itself.
 * Triggers: Triggers determine when an ability can be activated. Some triggers are active, requiring a player to make a conscious choice to use them, while others are passive, activating automatically when certain conditions are met.
 * Conditions: Conditions add complexity to abilities by introducing "if-then" logic. They determine whether an effect is applied, how it is applied, or when it can be activated.

By mastering these components and understanding how they interact, you can create abilities that are not only powerful and effective but also balanced and engaging. This guide will delve into each of these components in detail, providing you with the knowledge and tools you need to craft the abilities that will define your Quantum Nexus creations.

## II. Effects

In the realm of Quantum Nexus abilities, effects are the heart of the action. They dictate what happens when an ability is triggered, causing changes to the game state, influencing the battlefield, and ultimately determining the fate of your cards and your opponent's.

Think of effects as the verbs in the sentences of your abilities. They are the actions that bring your cards to life, transforming them from static entities into dynamic forces that shape the course of the game. Whether it's a bolt of energy vaporizing an enemy unit, a surge of psionic power manipulating the battlefield, or a divine blessing bolstering your defenses, effects are what make Quantum Nexus abilities so captivating and strategically rich.

### Categorizing Effects

Effects in Quantum Nexus are categorized into two main types:

 * Beneficial Effects: These effects have a positive impact on their target. They heal, enhance, protect, or otherwise improve the game state for the player activating the ability.
 * Detrimental Effects: These effects have a negative impact on their target. They deal damage, weaken, destroy, or otherwise hinder the target, creating an advantage for the player activating the ability.
Important Note: The categorization of an effect as beneficial or detrimental depends on the target. For instance, a healing effect is beneficial when targeting your own unit but becomes detrimental when used to heal an opponent's unit. This dynamic adds a layer of strategic depth to ability creation, allowing for versatile effects that can be used in various ways depending on the situation.

### Types of Effects

Quantum Nexus offers a diverse array of effects, each with its own unique impact on the game. Here are some of the most common types of effects you'll encounter:

 * Deal Damage: This effect reduces the Defense value of a target, potentially destroying it if the damage exceeds its Defense.
 * Heal: This effect restores the Defense value of a target, increasing its resilience and potentially saving it from destruction.
 * Boost Stats: This effect increases the Attack or Defense value of a target, making it more formidable in combat or more resistant to damage.
 * Reduce Stats: This effect decreases the Attack or Defense value of a target, weakening its offensive or defensive capabilities.
 * Draw Cards: This effect allows the player to draw a specified number of cards from their deck, increasing their options and hand size.
 * Discard Cards: This effect forces a player to discard a specified number of cards from their hand or deck, limiting their options and disrupting their strategy.
 * Destroy Card: This effect removes a target card from the game, permanently eliminating it from play.
 * Exile Card: This effect removes a target card from the game, similar to destroying it, but with potential differences in how certain game mechanics interact with exiled cards.
 * Manipulate Card Positions: This broad category encompasses effects that move cards between different areas of play, such as returning a unit to its owner's hand, shuffling a card into a deck, or rearranging units on the battlefield.
 * Gain CP: This effect adds CP to the player's CP pool, increasing their resources and allowing them to play more cards or activate more abilities.
 * Grant Keyword: This effect adds a keyword to a target card, granting it a special ability or modifying its existing abilities.
 * Remove Keyword: This effect removes a keyword from a target card, negating its special ability or altering its existing abilities.
 * Change Attack Range: This effect modifies a unit's attack range, potentially allowing it to attack from farther away or restricting its range.
Examples of Effects in Action
 * "Psionic Blast" deals 3 damage to a target unit.
 * "Healing Touch" restores 2 Defense to a target unit or Asset.
 * "Blessing of Light" gives a target unit +1 Attack.
 * "Arcane Shield" adds 2 Defense to a target unit.
 * "Weakening Curse" reduces a target unit's Attack by 2.
 * "Arcane Surge" allows the player to draw 2 cards.
 * "Mind Control" forces the opponent to discard a card from their hand.
 * "Destroy" removes a target unit with an Attack higher than its Defense from the game.
 * "Banish" exiles a target unit from the game.
 * "Teleport" moves a target unit from one quadrant to another.
 * "Energy Surge" grants the player +2 CP for the remainder of the turn.
 * "Empower" grants the "Flying" keyword to a target unit.
 * "Dispel Magic" removes all keywords from a target unit.
 * "Sniper Rifle" increases a target unit's attack range by 1 quadrant.

By understanding the different types of effects and how they can be combined with targets, triggers, and conditions, you can create a vast array of abilities that will bring your Quantum Nexus cards to life and shape the strategic landscape of the game.

## III. Targets

In Quantum Nexus, every effect needs a target. Targets define the object or entity that an ability's effect will act upon. They are the "who" or "what" that will be impacted by the ability. Selecting the right target is crucial for creating abilities that are both effective and strategically interesting.

Think of targets as the objects of the verbs in your ability sentences. They are the recipients of the action, the things that will be changed or influenced by the effect. Whether it's a powerful enemy unit being blasted with a laser beam, a friendly asset receiving a protective shield, or a player's CP pool being drained, targets are what make Quantum Nexus abilities so dynamic and versatile.

### Target Categories

Quantum Nexus offers a wide range of possible targets, allowing for a great deal of creativity and strategic depth in ability design. Here are some of the main target categories:

 * Card: This is the most common target category, encompassing all the different types of cards in the game.
   * Unit: A card representing a character or vehicle used for attacking and defending.
   * Leader: A powerful unit card with enhanced abilities.
   * Asset: A persistent card that provides ongoing benefits or activates special abilities.
   * Event: A card played for a one-time powerful effect.
   * Upgrade: A card that modifies another card's stats or grants new abilities.
   * Terrain: A card that represents different environments on the battlefield.
 * Deck: This category includes the different parts of a player's deck.
   * Draw Deck: A player's shuffled collection of cards from which they draw.
   * Discard Pile: A pile where destroyed or used cards are placed.
 * Stats: This category refers to the numerical values associated with cards or players.
   * Attack Value: A unit's offensive power.
   * Defense Value: A unit's or asset's resilience.
 * Player: This category simply refers to one of the players in the game.
 * Game Element: This category encompasses various elements of the game itself.
   * Quadrant: A section of the battlefield where units are deployed.
   * Loadout Area: The designated space for placing Asset cards.
   * Initiative: Determines which player acts first within a phase.
Examples of Targets in Abilities
 * "Arcane Bolt" deals 2 damage to a target Unit.
 * "Repair" restores 3 Defense to a target Asset.
 * "Empower" grants +1 Attack to all Units in a target Quadrant.
 * "Draw 2 cards" targets the Player activating the ability.
 * "Mind Control" forces the Opponent to discard a card.

By carefully selecting the right target for your effect, you can create abilities that are strategically interesting, thematically appropriate, and contribute to the overall balance and excitement of Quantum Nexus.

## IV. Triggers

In Quantum Nexus, triggers are the catalysts that bring abilities to life. They define the specific conditions or events that must occur for an ability to activate. Think of triggers as the "when" or "why" behind an ability's execution. They add a layer of strategic timing and decision-making to the game, ensuring that abilities are not simply used at any moment but require careful planning and execution.

Imagine triggers as the sparks that ignite the flames of your abilities. They are the cues that tell your cards when to unleash their powers, whether it's a unit striking back when attacked, an asset activating its defenses when a certain condition is met, or an event disrupting the battlefield at a crucial moment. Triggers are what make Quantum Nexus abilities so dynamic and interactive, creating a constant flow of strategic possibilities.

### Types of Triggers

Triggers in Quantum Nexus can be categorized into two main types:

 * Active Triggers: These triggers require a player to make a conscious decision to activate an ability. They often involve a cost, such as paying CP or discarding a card, and give players control over when to use their abilities.
 * Passive Triggers: These triggers activate automatically when certain conditions are met, without requiring any player input. They add an element of surprise and create dynamic interactions on the battlefield.
Examples of Active Triggers
 * Resource Cost (CP): Pay a specific amount of CP to activate an ability.
   * Example: "Calculated Strike (3 CP)"
 * Card Activation: Activate a card's inherent ability or attach a card to another.
   * Example: "Adapt" - Discard a card. This unit gains +2 Attack until the end of the turn.
 * Card Discard: Discard a card as a cost to activate an ability.
   * Example: "Emergency Power" - Discard a card to gain 3 CP.
Examples of Passive Triggers
 * Unit Deployment: Triggered when a specific unit type or faction is deployed.
   * Example: "Hive Mind Synergy" - Whenever another friendly Zyn unit is deployed within range, that unit gains +1 Attack until the end of the turn.
 * Unit Attack/Defense: Triggered when a unit is declared as an attacker or when a unit is attacked.
   * Example: "Fear" - This unit cannot be targeted by attacks or abilities for the rest of the turn.
 * Unit Destruction: Triggered when a unit is destroyed.
   * Example: "Adapt and Overcome" - Whenever a friendly Ferro-Sapien unit is destroyed, discard a card from your hand. If you do, you may search your deck for a Ferro-Sapien unit with a CP Cost equal to or less than the destroyed unit’s CP Cost and deploy it to the battlefield.
 * Conditional Triggers: Triggered when a specific set of conditions is met, often involving board state or player actions.
   * Example: "Enhanced Growth" - When this unit enters a quadrant with a Terrain card, draw a card.

### Key Considerations for Trigger Design

 * Timing: Carefully consider when a trigger should activate to ensure it aligns with the ability's purpose and creates interesting strategic interactions.
 * Frequency: Balance the frequency of a trigger to avoid creating abilities that are too easily abused or too difficult to utilize effectively.
 * Clarity: Clearly define the conditions that activate a trigger to avoid confusion and ensure consistent gameplay.
 * Counterplay: Consider how opponents might interact with or counter a trigger, ensuring that abilities are not too one-sided or oppressive.
By mastering the art of trigger design, you can create abilities that are dynamic, interactive, and strategically engaging, adding depth and complexity to the Quantum Nexus experience.

## V. Conditions

In Quantum Nexus, conditions add a layer of complexity and strategic depth to abilities. Conditions are essentially "if-then" statements that determine whether an effect is applied, how it is applied, or when it can be activated. They introduce a layer of decision-making and adaptability to the game, allowing abilities to be more versatile and responsive to different situations.

Think of conditions as the "rules" or "requirements" that govern your abilities. They are the filters that determine when and how an effect takes place, adding a layer of strategic nuance to every action. Whether it's a unit gaining extra attack power "if" it's in a specific quadrant, an ability activating "when" a certain card is played, or an effect triggering "unless" the opponent pays a cost, conditions are what make Quantum Nexus abilities so dynamic and interactive.

### Common Conditionals

Here are some of the most common conditional phrases you'll encounter in Quantum Nexus:

 * If: This conditional checks for a specific state or event. The ability only activates if the condition is met at the moment the trigger occurs.
   * Example: "If your CP is less than 5, draw a card."
 * When: This conditional indicates that the ability activates automatically when a specific event happens. This implies continuous activation whenever the trigger occurs.
   * Example: "When this unit enters a quadrant with a Terrain card, draw a card."
 * During: This conditional specifies a particular phase of the game during which the ability can be activated.
   * Example: "During your Command Phase, you may discard a card to gain 2 CP."
 * After: This conditional triggers the ability after a specific action or event has been resolved.
   * Example: "After destroying an enemy unit, this unit gains +1 Attack."
 * Unless: This conditional reverses the typical conditional logic. The ability activates unless the specified condition is met.
   * Example: "Discard a card. Unless you do, lose 2 CP."

### Boolean Operators for Complex Conditions

To create even more complex and nuanced conditions, Quantum Nexus utilizes boolean operators. These operators allow you to combine multiple conditions, creating intricate logic that adds depth to your abilities.

 * And: Both conditions connected by "And" must be true for the ability to activate.
   * Example: "When this unit is attacked AND your CP is greater than 5, you may discard a card to deal 3 damage to the attacker."
 * Or: The ability activates if at least one of the conditions connected by "Or" is true.
   * Example: "When a friendly unit is deployed OR an enemy unit is destroyed, gain 1 CP."
 * Not: The ability activates only if the condition following "Not" is false.
   * Example: "Draw a card. Not if you have 5 or more cards in hand."
 * Xor: (Exclusive Or) The ability activates if exactly one of the conditions connected by "Xor" is true, but not both.
   * Example: "Xor: If this unit is in the front row, it gains +2 Attack. If this unit is in the back row, it gains +2 Defense."
Examples of Conditions in Abilities
 * "If this unit is in the Front Row, it gains +1 Attack."
 * "When another friendly unit is deployed, this unit gains +1 Defense."
 * "During your Command Phase, you may pay 2 CP to draw a card."
 * "After this unit attacks, it gains +1 Attack."
 * "Unless you control a Technology unit, this ability costs 2 more CP to activate."
By mastering the use of conditionals and boolean operators, you can create abilities that are adaptable, responsive, and strategically engaging, adding a new dimension of complexity and excitement to Quantum Nexus.

## VI. Ability Costing and Card Creation

In Quantum Nexus, the creation of cards and mission cards is a meticulous process that involves careful balancing of various factors, including the intricate costs associated with abilities. The Ability Point (AP) system, as detailed in these guidelines, plays a crucial role in this balancing act, ensuring that abilities are appropriately costed and contribute to a fair and engaging gameplay experience.

Think of the Ability Creation Guidelines as the blueprint for crafting the individual components of a Quantum Nexus card, while the Card and Mission Card Creation Guidelines serve as the architect's plan for assembling those components into a cohesive and balanced structure. The AP system, in essence, is the cost estimator, ensuring that the final design doesn't exceed the allotted budget.

### The Interplay of Abilities, Cards, and Mission Cards

Abilities, in their various forms, are the building blocks of cards and mission cards. They define the actions, reactions, and overall impact of these cards within the game. The AP system, therefore, is intrinsically linked to the card and mission card creation process, ensuring that the abilities assigned to a card are commensurate with its overall power level and strategic role.

Key Points to Remember

 * Abilities as Components: Abilities, whether they manifest as active abilities, passive abilities, or keywords, are the functional components of cards and mission cards. They determine how these cards interact with the game and influence its strategic landscape.
 * AP System as Cost Estimator: The AP system provides a structured framework for costing abilities based on their power, versatility, and overall impact. It ensures that abilities are appropriately balanced and contribute to a fair and engaging gameplay experience.
 * Card and Mission Card Creation as Assembly: The Card and Mission Card Creation Guidelines provide the framework for assembling abilities and other card attributes into cohesive and balanced cards. The AP system ensures that the final design doesn't exceed the allotted budget for abilities.
 * Synergy and Balance: The AP system encourages synergy between abilities and other card attributes, ensuring that the final card design is not only powerful but also strategically interesting and thematically appropriate.

### Calculating Ability Costs

In Quantum Nexus, the AP cost of an ability isn't simply a fixed value; it's a dynamic calculation based on the various components that make up the ability. Each element — the effect, target, trigger, and any conditions — contributes to the overall AP cost, ensuring that the final cost accurately reflects the ability's power and versatility.

Think of it like constructing a powerful artifact in the Quantum Nexus universe. Each component you add, each enchantment you weave, and each safeguard you put in place increases the artifact's value and, consequently, its cost. Similarly, the more intricate and potent your ability becomes with the addition of specific effects, targets, triggers, and conditions, the higher its AP cost will be.

### Breakdown of AP Cost Factors

Here's how each component contributes to the overall AP cost:

 * Effect: The core of the ability, the effect itself, has a base AP cost. More powerful or versatile effects naturally cost more. For example, dealing 4 damage will typically cost more than dealing 2 damage.
 * Target: The target of the ability also influences the AP cost. Abilities that target multiple units or a broader scope (like a whole quadrant) generally cost more than those targeting a single unit.
 * Trigger: The type of trigger affects the cost. Active triggers, which require player choice and often involve a resource cost, generally have a lower AP cost than passive triggers that activate automatically.
 * Conditions: Adding conditions to an ability increases its complexity and potentially its power. Each condition adds to the AP cost, with more intricate or restrictive conditions costing more.

#### Example:

Let's break down a hypothetical ability and calculate its AP cost:

 * Effect: Deal 3 damage.
 * Target: Any unit (enemy or friendly).
 * Trigger: Passive - When this unit is attacked.
 * Condition: If the attacking unit has a higher Attack value than this unit.
Cost Calculation:
 * Effect (Base): Dealing 3 damage might have a base cost of 3 AP.
 * Target: Targeting any unit adds some versatility, increasing the cost by 1 AP.
 * Trigger: A passive trigger adds to the cost, say, 2 AP.
 * Condition: The "if" condition adds another 1 AP.

Total AP Cost: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 AP

Important Notes:

 * The AP costs are guidelines. The exact values can be adjusted based on the specific needs of your ability and the overall balance of the game.
 * Playtesting is crucial. Observe how the ability performs in actual gameplay and fine-tune the AP cost as needed to achieve the desired level of balance and strategic depth.

### The AP System in Action

Let's illustrate how the AP system integrates with the card and mission card creation process:

 * Card Concept: You envision a powerful technology-based unit with abilities that disrupt the opponent's strategy.
 * Domain Points and Rarity: You assign appropriate Domain Points (DP) and determine the card's rarity, which influences its initial AP pool.
 * Ability Design: You design abilities that align with the card's concept, such as an active ability to disable an opponent's asset and a passive ability to disrupt their card draw.
 * AP Costing: Using the AP Cost Reference Table, you determine the AP cost of each ability, ensuring that the total cost doesn't exceed the card's AP pool.
 * Card Assembly: You assemble the card's attributes, including its abilities, stats, and flavor text, following the Card Creation Guidelines.
 * Playtesting and Iteration: You playtest the card, observe its performance, and make adjustments to its abilities or AP costs as needed to achieve the desired balance and strategic impact.

The Ability Creation Guidelines, along with the AP system, are indispensable tools for crafting the intricate components that power Quantum Nexus cards. By understanding the interplay between abilities, cards, and mission cards, and by applying the AP system thoughtfully, you can create cards that are balanced, engaging, and contribute to a dynamic and strategically rich gameplay experience.

## VII. Keywords

Keywords in Quantum Nexus are like special tags or labels attached to cards and abilities, giving them additional powers or modifying how they function. They add a layer of strategic depth and complexity to the game, creating unique interactions and opening up a world of tactical possibilities.

Think of keywords as special abilities or upgrades that enhance your cards or modify their existing powers. They can be anything from "Flying," which allows a unit to soar above the battlefield, to "Barrier," which provides a temporary shield against attacks, or "First Strike," which allows a unit to strike first in combat. Keywords are what make each card unique and contribute to the strategic diversity of Quantum Nexus.

### Types of Keywords

Keywords in Quantum Nexus can be broadly classified into three types:

 * Positive Keywords: These keywords grant beneficial effects to the card or ability they are associated with. They enhance a card's power, resilience, or versatility, giving it an edge in battle or strategic advantage.
 * Negative Keywords: These keywords impose drawbacks or limitations on the card or ability. They might weaken a card's stats, restrict its actions, or make it vulnerable to certain effects.
 * Neutral Keywords: These keywords introduce unique mechanics or interactions without inherently benefiting or hindering the card or ability. They add a layer of complexity and strategic depth, creating interesting possibilities and tactical considerations.

##$ Keywords and the AP System

Just like other abilities, keywords also have an associated AP cost. This cost is factored into the card's overall AP pool, ensuring that keywords are balanced within the card's design.

 * Positive Keywords: The AP cost of positive keywords is added to the card's total AP cost, reflecting the added power or versatility they provide.
 * Negative Keywords: The AP cost of negative keywords is subtracted from the card's total AP cost, balancing out the drawbacks or limitations they impose.
 * Neutral Keywords: Neutral keywords always add to the AP cost, as they introduce unique mechanics that can influence the game's strategic landscape.

### Examples of Keywords

Here are a few examples of keywords and their effects:

 * Flying: This unit cannot be blocked by units without Flying.
 * Barrier: The first time this unit would be discarded each turn, prevent that discard.
 * First Strike: This unit deals damage before units without First Strike.
 * Overload: When you activate this ability, you may pay X additional CP. This ability gains additional effects based on the amount of CP paid.
 * Syphon Power: Whenever a unit you control with a higher rank than this unit is destroyed, this unit gains a +1/+1 counter.

Important Note: The AP costs for keywords are guidelines, and the actual cost may vary depending on the specific effect and overall balance of the game.

### Keywords and Strategic Depth

Keywords add a significant layer of strategic depth to Quantum Nexus. They encourage players to consider card interactions, build decks with specific synergies, and adapt their tactics based on the keywords present on both their own cards and their opponent's cards.

By understanding the different types of keywords and their impact on gameplay, you can create cards that are not only powerful and versatile but also strategically interesting and contribute to the rich tapestry of the Quantum Nexus universe.

## VIII. Additional Considerations

When crafting abilities in Quantum Nexus, it's essential to consider how they interact with the broader game mechanics and strategic landscape. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:

 * Turn Structure and Timing: Quantum Nexus has a structured turn sequence with distinct phases. The timing of your abilities—whether they activate during the Deployment, Command, or Battle phase—significantly impacts their strategic use. Consider how your abilities align with the game's flow and whether they offer advantages in specific phases.
 * Card Interactions: Abilities don't exist in isolation. They interact with other cards, abilities, and game elements. Consider how your abilities might synergize with or counter other cards, creating interesting combos or strategic counterplay opportunities.
 * Playtesting and Balance: The true test of an ability's effectiveness and balance lies in playtesting. Observe how your abilities perform in actual gameplay, gather feedback from players, and be prepared to make adjustments to ensure they are fair, engaging, and contribute to a dynamic gameplay experience.
 * Thematic Integration: While functionality is crucial, don't forget the thematic element. Abilities should align with the card's overall theme, domain, and flavor. A fire-based magic card, for instance, should have abilities that evoke fiery destruction or protective flames, while a technology card might focus on enhancements, debuffs, or battlefield manipulation.

By keeping these additional considerations in mind, you can create abilities that are not only mechanically sound but also thematically integrated and contribute to the rich tapestry of the Quantum Nexus universe.
