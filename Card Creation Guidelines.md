# Card Creation Guidelines for Quantum Nexus

## Card Types

Quantum Nexus features five card types, each with its unique role:

### Unit Cards

These cards represent characters and creatures critical for both offence and defence. Unit cards have Attack and Defense values, as well as a defined Range (close, mid, or far).

### Upgrade Cards

Upgrade cards enhance units and other cards, boosting their capabilities. Upgrade cards also have Attack and Defense values.

### Asset Cards

Asset cards provide ongoing effects that influence the battlefield. They have a Defense value to protect them.

### Event Cards

Event cards create temporary effects that last for a single turn, introducing dynamic elements to the game.

### Terrain Cards

Terrain cards grant bonuses to units on the battlefield, altering the strategic landscape.

## Domain Point Allocation

In Quantum Nexus, cards are allocated Domain Points from four domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. 

Each card can have between 0 and 6 points across these domains, ensuring a balanced distribution with no domain exceeding 4 points.

Domain Points represent how advanced a card is in a particular domain. Cards must allocate at least 1 point to any domain mentioned in their attributes, abilities, name, or description.

## Disciplines

Each domain has several associated disciplines, allowing for diverse card abilities. For each point assigned to a domain, select a relevant discipline within that domain. The total points assigned to chosen disciplines in a domain should not exceed those allocated to that domain.

## Card Feel

Cards in Quantum Nexus are defined using three axes

- Malevolence: Cards can be Neutral, Malevolent (evil-themed), or Benevolent (good-themed).
- Utility: Cards can be Utility-focused (creating order), Neutral, or Disruptive (creating chaos).Combat: Cards can lean towards Offense, Neutrality, or Defense.
- Impact: Cards can be Constructive (focus on creation), Neutral, or Destructive (focus on card removal).

## Functional Attributes

Define a card's attributes, such as rule box effects, Rank, and CP, while considering the Domain Points allocated and the chosen disciplines.

### Rulebox Effects

The rule ox can have Active abilities, passive abilities, interrupts, and mandatory interrupts. The more domain points assigned, the more potent the effects become. Multiple types of rule box effects can be set at once. Specificity can be used as a balancing mechanism.

### CP Assignment

Ensure that the CP (Command Points) cost is defined. Each Domain Point adds 2 to 5 CP; higher numbers should be used to balance the rule box effects. Attack and Defense values add approximately 1 CP for every two points, using the ceiling function for calculation.

### Rank

Specify if the card is Terrestrial, Aerial, Orbital, or Interstellar.

## Flavor Attributes

Finally, the card name can be assigned while considering everything that was decided earlier.

A detailed description of the card image needs to be created.

A set of flavour text no longer than 255 characters must also be drafted.
