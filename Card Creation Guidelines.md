# Card Creation Guidelines for Quantum Nexus

1. **Basic Feel**:
   - Define the card's nature using five axes:
     - Malevolence (Neutral, Malevolent, Benevolent)
      - Malevolent cards create a theme of evilness, sadism, masochism, and other similar terms.
      - Benevolent cards have a theme of goodness, righteousness, saintlyness, etc..
     - Utility (Utility-focused, Neutral, Disruptive)
      - Utility-focused cards generally create order or structure.
      - Distuptive cards create chaos.
     - Combat (Offense, Neutrality, Defense)
     - Range (Close Quarters, Neutral Range, Ranged)
     - Impact (Constructive, Neutral, Destructive)
      - Constructive cards focus on creation, multiplication, etc...
      - Destructive cards focus on card removal and other similar styles.

2. **Domain Points Allocation**:
   - Allocate between 0 and 6 points across four domains:
     - Technology
     - Magic
     - Psionics
     - Divinity
   - Ensure balanced distribution, with no domain exceeding 4 points.
   - Assign at least 1 point to any domain mentioned in the card's attributes, abilities, name, or description.

3. **Domain Disciplines**:
   - For each point assigned to a domain, select a relevant discipline within that domain.
   - The total points assigned to chosen disciplines in a domain should not exceed the total points allocated to that domain.
