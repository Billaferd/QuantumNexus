# Card Creation Guidelines

This guide will allow designers to create more consistent, balanced, and exciting cards.

**Basic Feel:**

- Use five axes to define a card's nature:
    - Malevolence: Decide if it's malevolent, neutral, or benevolent.
    - Utility: Specify if it's utility-focused, neutral, or disruptive.
    - Combat: Determine if it leans toward offense, defense, or neutrality.
    - Range: Indicate if it operates in close quarters, has neutral range, or is ranged.
    - Impact: Decide if its impact is constructive, neutral, or destructive.
1. **Domain Points:**
    - Assign 0 to 6 points to four domains:
        - Technology: Reflects technological influence.
        - Magic: Represents the presence of magical elements.
        - Psionics: Indicates the use of psychic or mental powers.
        - Divinity: Denotes a connection to divine or religious aspects.
    - Distribute domain points based on the thematic and strategic focus of the card. You have the freedom to emphasize certain domains while leaving others with fewer points or even none at all.
    - Ensure that no domain exceeds 4 points, maintaining a balanced distribution of influences.
2. Domain Disciplines
    1. For every point in each domain, select a random discipline for that domain
    2. If there are two points in a domain then two disciplines would be chosen. If three points, then three disciplines and so forth.
      - If three points were chosen for Magic, one possible set of disciplines would be: Elemental Magic, Enchantment, and Necromancy.
    3. These disciplines will dictate the flavour and direction of the card. All disciplines must be considered.
