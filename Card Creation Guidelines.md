# Card Creation Guidelines for Quantum Nexus

## Card Types

Quantum Nexus features five card types, each with its unique role:

### Unit Cards

These cards represent characters and creatures critical for both offence and defence. Unit cards have Attack and Defense values, as well as a defined Range (close, mid, or far).

### Upgrade Cards

Upgrade cards enhance units and other cards, boosting their capabilities. Upgrade cards also have Attack and Defense values.

### Asset Cards

Asset cards provide ongoing effects that influence the battlefield. They have a Defense value to protect them.

### Event Cards

Event cards create temporary effects that last for a single turn, introducing dynamic elements to the game.

### Terrain Cards

Terrain cards grant bonuses to units on the battlefield, altering the strategic landscape.

## Domain Point Allocation

In Quantum Nexus, cards are allocated Domain Points from four domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. 

Each card can have between 0 and 6 points across these domains, ensuring a balanced distribution with no domain exceeding 4 points.

Domain Points represent how advanced a card is in a particular domain. Cards must allocate at least 1 point to any domain mentioned in their attributes, abilities, name, or description.

## Disciplines

Each domain has several associated disciplines, allowing for diverse card abilities. For each point assigned to a domain, select a relevant discipline within that domain. The total points assigned to chosen disciplines in a domain should not exceed those allocated to that domain.

## Card Feel

Cards in Quantum Nexus are defined using three axes

- Malevolence: Cards can be Neutral, Malevolent (evil-themed), or Benevolent (good-themed).
- Utility: Cards can be Utility-focused (creating order), Neutral, or Disruptive (creating chaos).Combat: Cards can lean towards Offense, Neutrality, or Defense.
- Impact: Cards can be Constructive (focus on creation), Neutral, or Destructive (focus on card removal).

## Functional Attributes

Define a card's attributes, such as rule box effects, Rank, and CP, while considering the Domain Points allocated and the chosen disciplines.

### Rulebox Effects

The rule ox can have Active abilities, passive abilities, interrupts, and mandatory interrupts. The more domain points assigned, the more potent the effects become. Multiple types of rule box effects can be set at once. Specificity can be used as a balancing mechanism.

### CP Assignment

When creating cards for Quantum Nexus, it's crucial to consider the allocation of Domain Points and how they affect the CP (Command Points) assignment. Domain Points represent the card's proficiency in different domains, and they directly impact the CP cost of the card. Here's how to ensure Domain Points are properly integrated into the CP assignment:

1. Allocate Domain Points: Begin by determining how many Domain Points to allocate to each domain: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. These points reflect the card's thematic and mechanical qualities. Keep in mind that each domain point contributes to the CP cost.

2. Determine CP Contribution: Understand that each Domain Point allocated to a card adds to its CP cost. The specific CP contribution for each Domain Point can vary but typically falls within the range of 2 to 5 CP. This contribution reflects the card's specialization in a particular domain.

3. Consider Card Attributes: As you define the card's attributes, such as Attack and Defense values, rule box effects, and abilities, keep in mind that these attributes may influence the CP assignment. For example, Attack and Defense values contribute approximately 1 CP for every two points, rounded up.

4. Maintain Balance: Use CP assignment as a balancing mechanism. Cards with more potent rule box effects or higher Attack/Defense values should have a higher CP cost to ensure fair gameplay.

### Rank

Specify if the card is Terrestrial, Aerial, Orbital, or Interstellar.

## Flavor Attributes

Finally, the card name can be assigned while considering everything that was decided earlier.

A detailed description of the card image needs to be created.

A set of flavour text no longer than 255 characters must also be drafted.
