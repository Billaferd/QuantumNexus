# Card Creation Guidelines for Quantum Nexus

## General Info

### Battlefield

The battlefield is split into 3x2 field of 6 quadrants. Each row or column of quadrants is referred to as a section.

### Range

Close-range attacks and abilities can only target quadrants directly above and directly to each side. Mid-range abilities and attacks can target the quadrants above and to the sides, bit they can also target the top right and left diagonals. Far-ranged cards can only target one row away. This means that a far-ranged card in the back row can target the opponents front row and if it is in the front row, it can target the opponents back row.

## Card Types

Quantum Nexus features five card types, each with its unique role:

### Unit Cards

These cards represent characters and creatures critical for both offense and defense. Unit cards have Attack and Defense values, as well as a defined Range (close, mid, or far). Units can only be deployed onto the battlefield.

### Leader Cards

Leader cards are power cards that are similar to units. They do get a 50% discount on the costs though, because only 1 of any type is allowed, and only one leader at all is allowed in a single quadrant at a time. Their effects generally affect all units in their quadrant.

### Upgrade Cards

Upgrade cards enhance units and other cards, boosting their capabilities. Upgrade cards also have Attack and Defense values. Upgrade cards can be deployed onto the battlefield or loadout depending on the target of the upgrade.

### Asset Cards

Asset cards provide ongoing effects that influence the battlefield. They have a Defense value to protect them. Asset cards can only be deployed to the loadout. If they interact with a quadrant or section it must be chosen either at deployment or at the beginning of each turn.

### Event Cards

Event cards create temporary effects that last for a single turn, introducing dynamic elements to the game.

### Terrain Cards

Terrain cards grant bonuses to units on the battlefield, altering the strategic landscape. Terrain cards can only be deployed to the battlefield.

## Card Subtypes

All cards have a subtype. Subtypes allow the card's primary type to be more specific. All of the main types share the same subtypes. This will enable players to take in the information since it is familiar.

### Examples

| Subtype | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mech | Mechanized Infantry |
| Squad | Soldiers that act as a group |
| Specialist | A soldier who operates independently and has specialized skills |

## Rank

Specify if the card is Terrestrial, Aerial, Orbital, or Interstellar. All cards must have a rank.

Terrestrial cards are any card type that can be deployed into the battlefield and typically have close or mid-range attacks and abilities, although they can have a far range at times as well.

Aerial cards can also be any card type deployed on the battlefield; these cards typically have mid to far-range attacks and abilities and have the flying keyword.

Orbital Cards can be any card type that can be deployed to the loadout and typically affect an entire quadrant at a time on the battlefield.

Interstellar cards can be any card type deployed to the loadout and typically target Orbital type cards or affect entire battlefield sections (Rows or Columns).

## Domain Point Allocation

In Quantum Nexus, cards are allocated Domain Points from four domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity.

Each card can have between 0 and 6 points across these domains, ensuring a balanced distribution with no domain exceeding 4 points.

Domain Points represent how advanced a card is in a particular domain. Cards must allocate at least 1 point to any domain mentioned in their attributes, abilities, name, or description.

Domains have a certain feel to them, as is described next.

### Technology

Technology cards generally attack at a distance; mid and far-range attacks are much more common than close-range attacks. Technology abilities are generally destructive and lack precision most of the time. Technological cards can be precise, but this is not as common as abilities that affect entire quadrants or even battlefield sections. Technology users rely on Aerial, Orbital or Interstellar cards for battlefield dominance. Terrestrial cards, although rare, are generally heavily armoured and mid-ranged.

### Magic

The magic domain primarily deals in the close to mid-range. Far-range is available but not very common. Magic users have powerful, precise abilities that excel at the removal of specific targets. Magic users have issues against large crowds. Terrestrial cards are the most common, but aerial cards are also used. It is scarce for magic users to unleash their orbital or interstellar powers.

### Psionics

Psionics users rely on extremely close range but can also take care of large crowds and single threats. They tend to rely on control of the battlefield and use their opponent's minds against them. Anything other than terrestrial cards is rare.

## Divinity

Divine cards are mostly far-ranged and indirect. They rely on their deities for intervention and excel at inflicting status ailments. They cannot single out specific targets but they can lay waster to large sections of the battlefield.

### CP Assignment

When creating cards for Quantum Nexus, it's crucial to consider the allocation of Domain Points and how they affect the CP (Command Points) assignment. Domain Points represent the card's proficiency in different domains, and they directly impact the CP cost of the card.

1. Allocate Domain Points: Determine how many to allocate to each domain: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. These points reflect the card's thematic and mechanical qualities. Keep in mind that each domain point contributes to the CP cost.
2. Determine CP Contribution: Understand that each Domain Point allocated to a card adds to its CP cost. The specific CP contribution for each Domain Point can vary but typically falls within the range of 2 to 5 CP. This contribution reflects the card's specialization in a particular domain. For example, if a card has two domain points it would have somewhere between 4 and 10 CP.
3. The actual point value would be up to the designer, but should fall within the values that are calculated in the step above. If in doubt, simply pick a random number within the range of 2 to 4 and multiply by the total number of domain points.

## Disciplines

Each domain has several associated disciplines, allowing for diverse card abilities. For each point assigned to a domain, select a relevant discipline within that domain. The total points assigned to chosen disciplines in a domain should not exceed those allocated to that domain. Each domain with a point must have one discipline selected.

### Technology Domain

- Cybernetics: Focusing on advanced mechanical enhancements and robotic units.
- Energy Weapons: Specializing in high-tech energy-based weaponry and tactics.
- Robotics: Emphasizing the use of powerful mechanized units, including mechs.
- Genetics: Manipulating the genetic makeup of units and assets for various effects.

### Magic Domain

- Elemental Magic: Harnessing the powers of fire, water, earth, and air for various effects.
- Enchantment: Enriching units and assets with magical enhancements and buffs.
- Summoning: Conjuring creatures or beings from other realms to fight for you.
- Alchemy: Transforming and transmuting objects and units using mystical concoctions.

### Psionics Domain

- Telekinesis: Controlling objects and units with the power of the mind.
- Mind Control: Dominating the thoughts and actions of enemy units.
- Precognition: Gaining insights into future events for strategic advantage.
- Astral Projection: Sending your consciousness to distant locations for reconnaissance and manipulation.

### Divinity Domain

- Holy Light: Channeling divine energy for healing and purification.
- Divine Wrath: Smiting enemies with powerful, righteous attacks.
- Blessings: Bestowing boons and protections upon allies.
- Divine Intervention: Calling upon higher powers for miraculous effects and divine guidance.

## Card Feel

Cards in Quantum Nexus are defined using three axes

- Malevolence: Cards can be Neutral, Malevolent (evil-themed), or Benevolent (good-themed).
- Utility: Cards can be Utility-focused (creating order), Neutral, or Disruptive (creating chaos).Combat: Cards can lean towards Offense, Neutrality, or Defense.
- Impact: Cards can be Constructive (focus on creation), Neutral, or Destructive (focus on card removal).

## Functional Attributes

Define a card's attributes, such as rule box effects, Rank, and CP, while considering the Domain Points allocated and the chosen disciplines.

### Attack and Defense

Attack and defense will cost a rate of about 1 purchase point for every two Attack and/or Defense rounded down. The Attack and Defense values are summed for the purchase calculation (Ceiling((Attack+Defense)/2)).

### Rule Box Effects

The rule box holds active abilities, passive abilities, interrupts, and mandatory interrupts. The rule box can hold multiples of these but each rule will add to the purchase cost. The purchase cost of the rule box effects and the attack/defense values should be equal to the numeric value of the deployment cost. The total cost of the attack/defense values and all of the rule box effects must be equal to the numeric value of the deployment cost.

#### Abilities

A cards abilities will always have a cost, even if that cost is zero. The ability will always have the form `Cost[, Cost] - Ability`. The cost of an ability can be used to partially balance a card by changing it. Abilities can have compound costs and costs don't strictly have to be CP, discarding a card, skipping a turn, and destroying a card are all valid costs. An example ability text would be `3CP - Force an opponent to discard a card`. A more advanced example with a compound cost would be `2CP, Discard 1 - Deal 3 damage to an enemy in Mid-range`. Passive abilities don't have a cost associated, an example would be `P, Other units in this quadrant gain +1 attack.`

#### Interrupts

Interrupts have a specific pattern that is used to describe who and what triggers it. The interrupt text has four parts:

`[Modifier] Target - Action`

Some examples include `Opposing Unit - Attack` and `Event - Deploy`.

##### Targets

Targets are the things that can trigger an interrupt.

## Flavor Attributes

Finally, the card name can be assigned while considering everything that was decided earlier.

A detailed description of the card image needs to be created.

A set of flavour text no longer than 255 characters must also be drafted.

## Example

First, we will select the card type. In this case, it will be a Unit type card. The subtype will be Squad because these nano-bots operate as a group even though they are extremely small. This will appear on the card as `Unit - Squad`.

Second, we determine Domain Points; for this example, we will allocate 1 point to Technology and 1 point to Divinity.

We can select one discipline from technology and divinity each. In this case, we will use Nano-technology and Divine Aura.

We have two total domain points, so we have between 4 and 10 CP available. Let's start at 10 CP for the deployment cost.

For the general feel, we will select the following values:

- Malevolence: Malevolent
- Utility: Neutral
- Impact: Destructive

We will assign 1 defense and 2 attack to the card. This will use 2 CP. We are leaving 5 for the rule box effects.

For the rule box effects, we will assign an interrupt of `this - deploy,` triggering every time this specific unit enters play. This interrupt will cause the player to pick up a card. This equals about 4 CP, with the interrupt type providing a 1x multiplier. That is three CP used so far. For the last three, we will use the `this - discard` interrupt and assign the effect: Opponent discards one card from the top of their deck. This costs about 4 CP.

This will be a close ranged terrestrial unit.

The name of this card will be Blessed Scourge.

The image description will be: A scourge of nano-bots with a divine light radiating out of them.

The flavour text will be: Creeping across the land, the scourge brings us news.
