# Card Creation Guidelines for Quantum Nexus

## Domain Point Allocation

   - Allocate between 0 and 6 points across four domains:
     - Technology
     - Magic
     - Psionics
     - Divinity
  - Ensure balanced distribution, with no domain exceeding 4 points.
  - Assign at least 1 point to any domain mentioned in the card's attributes, abilities, name, or description.
  - The points represent how advanced this card will be. A 0 means that the domain is not being represented. A 4 means that the card will represent Transcendent Mastery of a domain.
  - In many cases there will be several domains assigned to a single card.

## Allocate Disciplines

Each domain has several disciplines assigned, this list can be expanded in future sets.

- For each point assigned to a domain, select a relevant discipline within that domain.
  - The total points assigned to chosen disciplines in a domain should not exceed the total points allocated to that domain.
  - If a card has a discipline, ensure its flavor, name, and effects reflect that discipline.
