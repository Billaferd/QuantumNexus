The warrior's eyes glow with an eerie, internal light, their features contorted in a mix of pain and ecstasy. They are surrounded by spectral figures, their forms shifting and indistinct, whispering promises of power into the warrior's ear. The figures' voices are a cacophony of whispers, a chorus of madness that promises unimaginable strength in exchange for their sanity.

Its head is dominated by a large, multifaceted eye that glows with a soft, blue light, its gaze constantly shifting as it calculates probabilities. A network of shimmering tendrils, resembling data streams, extend from its abdomen, connecting it to the surrounding drones and pulsing with bioluminescent energy. The background shows a distorted battlefield, with enemy units caught in a web of probabilistic distortions, their movements uncertain and their defenses weakened. | 3          | Zyn Collective     |
