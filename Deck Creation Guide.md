# Quantum Nexus Deck Creation Guide

## **Understanding the Game Mechanics**

Before building a deck, it's crucial to have a solid grasp of the basic game mechanics of Quantum Nexus:

*   **Objective:** The game aims to defeat your opponent by either forcing them to draw from an empty deck or completing all your mission cards.
*   **Card Types:** The game uses a variety of card types, including Units, Assets, Events, Upgrades, and Terrain. Each type has a specific role and contributes differently to your strategy. Familiarize yourself with each type and their functions to make informed deck-building choices.
*   **Command Points (CP):** CP is the resource used to play cards. Each card has a CP cost, and you have a limited amount each turn. Manage your CP wisely to deploy units, activate abilities, and play events effectively.
*   **Domains:** Mission cards and Unit cards are associated with domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. Your deck construction must align with the chosen domains on your mission cards. 
*   **Battlefield:** The battlefield is divided into quadrants, and unit positioning is crucial for attack ranges and strategic advantage.

## **Deck Construction Rules**

Quantum Nexus has specific rules for building decks:

*   **Deck Size:** Your deck must contain exactly 200 CP. This ensures a balanced game and prevents players from overwhelming opponents with too many powerful cards.
*   **Mission Cards:** You can include up to six mission cards, and the total domain points across all your mission cards must equal exactly 6. Additionally, no single domain can have more than 4 points. The total CP of all of your Mission Cards is the amount of CP available each turn.
*   **Leader Limit:** Only one Leader unit is allowed per quadrant, and the total CP of all Leader units in your deck cannot exceed 25.
*   **Domain Alignment:** The domain points on each unit card must match or be lower than the corresponding values on your chosen mission cards. For example, if a mission card requires 2 Technology points, your deck can only include unit cards with 2 or fewer Technology points.
*   **Duplicate Limits:** Each card has a duplicate limit. You cannot exceed this limit in your deck. 

## **Step-by-Step Deck Creation Process**

1.  **Choose a Faction:**  Select a faction based on its playstyle and card synergies. 
2.  **Select Mission Cards:** Choose up to six mission cards that represent your objectives and offer desirable passive effects or abilities. Ensure that the total domain points across the mission cards equal 6 and no single domain has more than 4 points.
3.  **Select a Leader Unit:** Choose Leader Units whose abilities align with your overall strategy. Remember the 25 CP limit for Leader cards.
4.  **Choose Units:** Select a variety of Unit cards that align with your mission card domains and contribute to your desired strategy. Consider their attack and defense values, attack range, and any special abilities that synergize with your other cards.
5.  **Choose Assets and Events:** Select Asset cards that provide ongoing benefits or activate special abilities, and Event cards for one-time powerful effects. Consider how they interact with your units and contribute to your overall game plan. 
6.  **Calculate Total CP:** Make sure the total CP of all cards, excluding mission cards, equals exactly 200 CP.
7.  **Playtesting and Refinement:** Test your deck against various opponents and refine it based on your performance. Adjust card ratios, experiment with different combinations, and analyze your wins and losses to improve your deck.

### **Additional Tips**

*   **Synergy:** Prioritize cards that synergize well with each other, creating powerful combinations and enhancing your overall strategy. 
*   **Balance:** Aim for a well-balanced deck with a mix of units, assets, and events that can handle different game situations.
*   **Flexibility:** Include cards that provide tactical flexibility, allowing you to adapt to your opponent's strategies. 
*   **Metagame Awareness:** Stay updated on the current popular decks and strategies in the community. This can help you anticipate threats and make informed deck-building choices.
