# Beginners Guide to Card Creation

## Welcome to Quantum Nexus!

This guide will get you started on designing cards for our exciting trading card game! In Quantum Nexus, you'll build decks without worrying about dice rolls or random card flips.  Instead, strategy and card combos will reign supreme!

## The Basics

* Cards come in five types: Units (fighters), Leaders (powerful units), Upgrades (enhancements), Assets (ongoing effects), and Events (temporary effects).
* Each card has a subtype like "Mech" or "Squad" to give more detail about its role.
* Cards also belong to a Domain (Technology, Magic, Psionics, or Divinity) reflecting their power source.

## Building Your Card

1. **Pick a card type (Unit, Leader, etc.) and subtype (Mech, Squad, etc.).**
2. **Choose a Domain (think of it as a power source) and assign 1-4 Domain Points to it.**
3. **Select Disciplines (specific aspects within a Domain) based on your points.**
4. **Consider the card's role in combat (offensive, defensive, or balanced).**
5. **Design an ability (active, passive, or triggered) following our format.**
6. **Set a card count (how many copies allowed in a deck) to influence its power.**

## Example

* **Card Type:** Unit - Squad
* **Domain:** Technology (1 point) with Nano-technology discipline
* **Divinity** (1 point) with Divine Aura discipline
* **Role:** Offensive
* **Ability:** Interrupt that makes you draw a card when the unit enters play, plus another interrupt that discards a card from your opponent's deck when you discard this unit.

## Remember

* Start simple! Focus on a core idea and build from there.
* Playtest your cards to see how they work together and make adjustments as needed.
* Explore different synergies between cards to create unique deck strategies.
