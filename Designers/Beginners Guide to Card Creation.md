# Beginners Guide to Card Creation

## Welcome to Quantum Nexus!

This guide will get you started on designing cards for our exciting trading card game! In Quantum Nexus, you'll build decks without worrying about dice rolls or random card flips.  Instead, strategy and card combos will reign supreme!

## The Basics

*   Cards in Quantum Nexus have several types, each with a unique role (see `Players/Quantum Nexus Full Game Rules.md` (FGR), Section IV for full details):
    *   **Units:** Your main fighting forces.
    *   **Leaders:** Powerful unique units with special rules.
    *   **Upgrades:** Enhancements for your Units or Assets.
    *   **Assets:** Provide ongoing effects from your Loadout Area.
    *   **Events:** One-time powerful effects.
    *   **Terrain:** Modify quadrants on the battlefield.
    *   **Mission Cards:** Define objectives and contribute to your Command Point (CP) pool.
*   Most cards have **Subtypes** (e.g., "Mech," "Squad," "Construct") for more thematic and mechanical detail.
*   Cards are also linked to one or more of four **Domains** (Technology, Magic, Psionics, or Divinity), reflecting their power source or nature.

## Building Your Card (Conceptual Steps)

1.  **Pick a Card Type and Subtype(s):** What kind of card is it? (e.g., Unit - Mech).
2.  **Choose Domain(s) and Assign Domain Points (DP):**
    *   A card can have points in multiple domains. For a single domain on this card, you might assign 1-4 DP as a design metric.
    *   **Note for Unit Cards:** The DP assigned to Unit cards have an important deck-building restriction: a Unit's DP in any domain must be equal to or lower than the total DP your chosen Mission Cards provide for that domain (see FGR Section II.C).
3.  **Select Disciplines (Optional):** These are thematic sub-categories within a Domain (e.g., "Robotics" under Technology, "Pyromancy" under Magic) to help flavor your card.
4.  **Consider its Role:** Especially for Units, is it offensive, defensive, or support-focused? For other cards, what is its main strategic purpose?
5.  **Design Abilities:** What does the card *do*? Abilities can be:
    *   **Active:** You choose to use this as an action (e.g., pay a cost to get an effect).
    *   **Passive:** Always "on" while the card is in play under certain conditions.
    *   **Triggered (includes "Interrupts"):** Happens automatically when a specific game event occurs.
6.  **Set a Card Count (Rarity/Duplicate Limit):** How many copies can be in a deck (e.g., 1, 2, or 3+)? This often reflects its power or uniqueness.

## Example

* **Card Type:** Unit - Squad
* **Domain & Disciplines:** Technology 1 (Nano-technology), Divinity 1 (Divine Aura)
* **Role:** Offensive
* **Abilities (Example):**
    *   Triggered: "When this unit enters play, draw a card."
    *   Triggered: "When this unit is sent to your Discard Pile from play, target opponent discards 1 card."

## Next Steps & Further Reading

*   **Start simple!** Focus on a core idea and build from there.
*   **Playtest your cards** to see how they work and make adjustments.
*   **Explore synergies** between cards to create unique strategies.
*   **Look at existing cards** in Quantum Nexus for inspiration!

This guide is just a starting point. For detailed rules on how cards function in the game, always refer to the **`Players/Quantum Nexus Full Game Rules.md` (FGR)**. For more in-depth design principles, including how a card's Command Point (CP) cost is determined and how abilities are balanced, consult the **`Designers/Quantum Nexus Card Creation Guidelines.md`** and the specific mini-guides for each card type.

With these basics, you're well on your way to creating your own awesome Quantum Nexus cards!
