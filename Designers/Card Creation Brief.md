# **Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Brief**

Card Name: \[Working Title\]  
Designer(s):  
Version: 0.1  
Date: \[Date of Creation\]

### **Phase 1: Conceptualization & Strategic Identity**

* **Core Concept & Lore:**(This is the "Lore" component. What is the story this card tells in a few sentences? What is its fantasy? Example: "A holy warrior whose faith is so strong it can unmake corrupting enchantments, creating a bastion of purity on the battlefield.")  
* **Player Experience & Agency:**(What choice does this card create for the player using it and the player facing it? Which player psychographic (Timmy, Johnny, Spike, Vorthos) does this most appeal to? Example: "This card gives the Divinity player a proactive way to protect their key units, forcing the Entropy player to solve this new problem before continuing their main strategy. It restores agency by offering a clear counter-play. Appeals to Spike for its efficiency and Vorthos for its thematic power.")  
* **Strategic Role (Threat / Answer Analysis):**(Is this card primarily a "Threat" that poses a new problem, or an "Answer" that solves an existing one? Which category from the Threat and Counter-Play Interaction Matrix does it fall into? Example: "This is an 'Answer' card. It functions as a 'Proactive Shield' against the 'State Application (Static)' threat.")

### **Phase 2: Mechanical Design**

* **Card Stats:**  
  * **Card Type:** (Unit, Asset, Event, Upgrade, Terrain, Mission)  
  * **Subtype(s):** (e.g., Leader, Construct, Spellcaster, etc.)  
  * **Domain(s) & DP Cost:** (e.g., Divinity 2 / Magic 2\)  
  * **Command Point (CP) Cost:** (Target Cost)  
  * **Attack / Defense:** (For Units/Assets)  
  * **Range:** (Close, Mid, Far \- For Units)  
  * **Duplicate Limit:** (Default 3, or specify)  
* **Rule Box Text:**  
  * **Keywords:** (e.g., Zeal, Territorial, Adapt, Static, Nullify)  
  * **Abilities (Passive/Active/Triggered):**(Write out the full proposed rules text as it would appear on the card.)  
  * **Flavor Text:**(A short, thematic sentence that reinforces the card's lore.)  
* **Mechanical Justification:**(Briefly explain how the chosen mechanics implement the Core Concept. Example: "The 'Zeal' keyword represents its resilience. The passive aura preventing 'Static' directly fulfills its role as a Proactive Shield.")

### **Phase 3: Art Direction**

* **Subject:**(This is the "Subject" component. Describe the primary focus of the art. Who or what are we looking at? Be specific about its appearance, gear, and key features. Example: "An armored knight of the Celestial sub-faction. Her armor is ornate, gilded metal mixed with consecrated stone. She holds a massive shield that emits a soft, golden light.")  
* **Scene & Composition:**(This is the "Scene." What is happening? How should the shot be framed according to the Art Bible's guidance for its Card Type? Example: "As a Unit card, this should be a character-focused medium shot. The subject is taking a defensive stance, planting her shield firmly as a wave of glitching, entropic energy (the Static effect) dissipates harmlessly against it.")  
* **Mood & Lighting:**(Describe the overall feeling. What is the primary source, quality, and color of light, according to the card's Domain(s)? Example: "The mood is one of defiant purity. The primary light is the radiant, volumetric golden light emanating from the subject's shield and halo (Divine Light), which powerfully pushes back the dark, glitching shadows of the Entropy effect.")  
* **Key VFX / Moment to Capture:**(What specific visual effect for a keyword or ability must be clearly illustrated? Example: "The key moment is the 'Static' effect being nullified. We need to see the digital noise and pixelation of the Entropy spell breaking apart and dissolving as it hits the golden, sacred energy of the unit's protective aura.")

### **Phase 4: Balancing & Playtest Notes**

* **Balancing Concerns:**(Are there any potential balance issues to watch for? Does this card risk invalidating other strategies too easily? Example: "Need to ensure the CP cost is high enough that playing this card is a significant tempo investment. If too cheap, it could shut down Entropy decks completely.")  
* **Key Interactions to Test:**(What specific card combinations or matchups should be tested? Example: "Test against mono-Entropy decks. Test how it interacts with effects that target units with specific keywords. Does its aura protect against AoE Static effects?")
