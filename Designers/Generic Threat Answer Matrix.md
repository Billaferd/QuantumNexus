| 1\. Wide Board / Swarm                 | (MtG) A card like Ratchet Bomb, where you pay mana each turn to add counters, then sacrifice it to destroy all permanents with a matching cost, often clearing out cheap tokens.                          | (YGO) A trap card like Torrential Tribute, which is activated in response to a summon and destroys all monsters on the field, resetting the board after the opponent has committed.                 | (MtG) An enchantment like Ghostly Prison, which forces the opponent to pay mana for each creature they wish to declare as an attacker, making a wide attack prohibitively expensive.                          | (FaB) An attack reaction like Pummel, which can be used to discard a card from the opponent's hand if it hits, potentially removing the card they needed for their next attack in a wide chain.          | (MtG) A card like Rakdos Charm, which has a mode that deals 1 damage to an opponent for each creature they control, directly punishing them for the size of their board.                                        | (YGO) The spell card Creature Swap, which forces you and your opponent to trade control of one monster each, allowing you to take their best creature in exchange for a weaker one.                                          | (MtG) A combo like Thassa's Oracle. The swarm player must shift from attacking your life total to trying to stop you from emptying your library, as your win condition doesn't involve the board state.                       | (Pokémon TCG) A Stadium card like Path to the Peak, which removes the abilities of all Pokémon with a Rule Box. This can shut down the synergy-providing abilities that enable a swarm strategy.         |
| 2\. Tall Creature / "Voltron"          | (FaB) Using a defense reaction like Unmovable. You pay resources to drastically increase its defense value for a turn, effectively "paying" to survive a single, massive attack from a "go-tall" hero.    | (MtG) An instant like Swords to Plowshares, which exiles the target creature, bypassing keywords like Indestructible and completely removing the heavily-invested-in threat.                        | (YGO) A continuous trap like Skill Drain, which negates the effects of all face-up monsters on the field, turning a powerful "boss monster" into a vanilla creature with just its base stats.                 | (MtG) A spell like Unsummon or Vapor Snag, which returns the target creature to its owner's hand. This forces the opponent to spend the mana and time to re-cast their threat, resetting their tempo.    | (MtG) An edict effect like Liliana of the Veil's -2 ability, which forces each player to sacrifice a creature. If the opponent only has their single "go-tall" creature, they are forced to sacrifice it.       | (YGO) A quick-play spell like Enemy Controller, which can be activated during the Battle Phase to change an opponent's monster to defense position, nullifying its high attack for the turn.                                 | (Pokémon TCG) Using a "mill" deck (e.g., with Durant). The opponent's single powerful Pokémon is irrelevant if it cannot stop you from running them out of cards in their deck to win the game.                               | (MtG) A land like Maze of Ith, which can untap an attacking creature and remove it from combat. This completely neutralizes a single, large attacker each turn without destroying it.                    |
| 3\. Disruptive Status / "Stax"         | (Pokémon TCG) The item card Full Heal, which allows a player to remove all Special Conditions from their Active Pokémon, directly trading a card for recovery from paralysis or poison.                   | (YGO) The quick-play spell Mystical Space Typhoon, which can be used to destroy an opponent's "Stax" piece (e.g., a continuous spell or trap like Gravity Bind) after it has been played.           | (MtG) A creature like Collector Ouphe, which prevents all players from activating abilities of artifacts. This proactively stops opponents from using artifacts to apply disruptive effects.                  | (MtG) Casting Memory Lapse, which counters a spell and puts it on top of its owner's library. This forces the opponent to re-draw and re-cast their disruptive piece, costing them a turn.               | (MtG) A card like The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale, which forces every player to pay a maintenance cost for every creature, creating a symmetrical resource drain that can punish the Stax player too.           | (YGO) A card like Grave of the Super Ancient Organism, which prevents high-level monsters from attacking/activating effects, can be used to redirect the "lock" back onto the opponent's own strategy.                       | (YGO) Using an alternate win condition like Exodia the Forbidden One. The opponent's strategy of locking down the board is irrelevant if you can assemble your win condition in your hand.                                    | (Pokémon TCG) Playing a Stadium card like Lost City. Any Pokémon knocked out goes to the Lost Zone instead of the discard pile, disrupting a strategy that relies on recurring status-appliers.          |
| 4\. Hand Disruption / Discard          | (YGO) The trap card Gryphon Wing, which can be activated when an effect that would make you discard is activated. It negates the effect and destroys the opponent's card, creating a 2-for-1 trade.       | (MtG) An enchantment like Library of Leng, which allows you to put cards discarded to an opponent's effect on top of your library instead of into your graveyard, recovering the card advantage.    | (MtG) A creature like Loxodon Smiter or a card with the Madness keyword. These provide value (e.g., putting the creature onto the battlefield) when discarded, turning disruption into a benefit.             | (YGO) Using a hand trap like Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring to negate the opponent's Card Destruction, preventing the hand discard effect from ever resolving and forcing them to waste their card.         | (MtG) The classic Hymn to Tourach vs. Hymn to Tourach. In mirror matches, both players are attacking each other's hands, creating a symmetrical battle of resource denial.                                      | (YGO) Many "Danger!" archetype monsters have effects that trigger if they are discarded by a card effect, allowing you to turn a discard from Card Destruction into a free special summon.                                   | (FaB) A "go-wide" strategy with a low-cost hero like Katsu. Hand disruption is less effective when your entire hand consists of low-cost, redundant combo pieces.                                                             | (MtG) The enchantment Leyline of Sanctity, which gives the player Hexproof. This prevents the opponent from targeting you with discard spells like Thoughtseize.                                         |
| 5\. Tempo Disruption / "Tap" Effects   | (MtG) A spell like To Arms!, which untaps all creatures you control at instant speed, allowing you to pay mana to recover from a mass-tap effect and still be able to block.                              | (FaB) A hero like Ira, Crimson Haze. If an opponent uses an effect to try and lock down your weapon, you can simply attack with your other dagger, recovering your ability to attack for the turn.  | (MtG) An artifact like Lightning Greaves grants a creature Haste and Shroud, preventing it from being targeted by "tap" effects and allowing it to act the turn it's played.                                  | (MtG) Using an instant like Twiddle to tap an opponent's creature in response to them trying to tap yours, creating a symmetrical tempo trade for the turn.                                              | (YGO) A card like Summon Limit, which restricts both players to only two summons per turn. This punishes strategies that rely on many actions in a single turn.                                                 | (MtG) Using a spell like Sudden Substitution to swap control of a spell on the stack, making their "tap all creatures" spell target their own creatures instead of yours.                                                    | (FaB) Playing as a hero like Bravo, Star of the Show. Your goal is to build up to a single, massive attack. Opponent's small tempo-disrupting attacks are irrelevant if they can't stop the inevitable blow.                  | (YGO) A field spell like Mystic Mine, which prevents the player who controls more monsters from attacking or activating effects. This completely changes the tempo of the game for both players.         |
| 6\. Positional Defense / "Pillow Fort" | (MtG) A spell like Distortion Strike, which you pay mana for to make a creature unblockable for a turn, paying a resource to bypass a wall of defenders.                                                  | (YGO) The spell card Raigeki, which simply destroys all of your opponent's monsters, reactively removing the defensive wall they have assembled.                                                    | (FaB) Using a weapon like Romping Club. If the opponent defends with multiple cards from hand, the weapon gains Overpower, proactively preventing them from being able to fully block it.                     | (MtG) A card like Griptide, which places a blocking creature on top of its owner's library. This removes the blocker and forces the opponent to waste their next draw to get it back.                    | (YGO) The trap card Needle Ceiling. If there are 4 or more monsters on the field, it destroys all face-up monsters, punishing both players for building up large defensive boards.                              | (MtG) An enchantment like Bedlam, which states creatures can't block. This re-routes all combat directly at players or other valid targets, disabling positional defense entirely.                                           | (MtG) A card like Revel in Riches. Your win condition is accumulating Treasure tokens, which has nothing to do with combat. Your opponent's defensive "fort" becomes irrelevant.                                              | (YGO) A Field Spell like Secret Village of the Spellcasters. If you control a Spellcaster and your opponent doesn't, they cannot activate spell cards, potentially shutting off their defensive engine.  |
| 7\. High-Impact Spells / Events        | (MtG) A counterspell like Mana Tithe, which forces the opponent to pay 1 extra mana for their spell or it is countered. This can stop a key spell if they are "tapped out."                               | (MtG) A card like Heroic Intervention, which can be cast in response to a board wipe like Wrath of God to give all of your permanents hexproof and indestructible for the turn.                     | (YGO) The trap card Solemn Judgment. By paying half your Life Points, you can negate the activation of a spell/trap card (like Raigeki) and destroy it, proactively stopping it.                              | (MtG) A card like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, which makes all non-creature spells cost 1 more mana to cast, slowing down the opponent's ability to play their game-changing spell.                      | (MtG) In a control mirror match, both players may use board wipes like Supreme Verdict. Your symmetrical board wipe punishes them if they overcommit to the board before you do.                                | (YGO) The hand trap Ghost Reaper & Winter Cherries. You can discard it to look at your opponent's Extra Deck and banish all copies of a card they control, changing the impact of their strategy.                            | (Pokémon TCG) Using a Pokémon like Wobbuffet with the Bide attack. It soaks up a big attack from a VMAX, then returns double the damage, presenting a problem that makes the opponent hesitate to use their high-impact move. | (YGO) A continuous trap like Imperial Order, which negates all spell effects on the field. This creates an environment where high-impact spell cards cannot be played by anyone.                         |
| 8\. Resilient Threats / "Sticky"       | (MtG) A card like Path to Exile. By paying mana for the spell, you can exile a creature with an on-death trigger (like Undying), preventing the trigger from occurring.                                   | (YGO) A monster like Knightmare Unicorn. Its effect shuffles a card on the field into the deck. This is a reactive answer that gets around "cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects" clauses. | (Pokémon TCG) The tool card Choice Belt. By attaching it to your Pokémon, it deals +30 damage to opposing V Pokémon, potentially letting you knock out a resilient threat in one hit before it can be healed. | (MtG) A card like Aether Adept, which returns a target creature to its owner's hand when it enters the battlefield. This removes the "sticky" creature without destroying it, forcing a re-cast.         | (YGO) The spell card Share the Pain, which forces both players to tribute one monster. This can force an opponent to sacrifice their own resilient monster that may have been immune to other forms of removal. | (MtG) Using a card like Control Magic to take control of the opponent's resilient creature, turning their hard-to-remove threat into your own.                                                                               | (FaB) Playing a Fatigue strategy. The opponent's single resilient threat is less relevant if your goal is to make them run out of cards in their deck by blocking all their attacks until they have no cards left.            | (MtG) The enchantment Rest in Peace, which exiles any card that would go to a graveyard. This completely turns off "sticky" mechanics like Persist, Undying, and most on-death triggers.                 |
| 9\. Forced Combat / "Taunt"            | (FaB) An attack reaction like Steadfast, which allows you to pay resources to prevent a certain amount of damage, mitigating the forced attack into a large threat.                                       | (MtG) Using an instant-speed removal spell like Fatal Push to destroy the "taunt" creature during the declare attackers step, freeing up your other creatures to attack their intended targets.     | (Pokémon TCG) A Pokémon like Flying Pikachu VMAX. Its attack is not affected by any effects on the opponent's Active Pokémon, allowing it to ignore "taunt"-like abilities that would redirect its damage.    | (YGO) A card like Book of Moon, which flips the "taunt" monster into face-down defense position, removing its continuous effect and allowing you to attack other targets.                                | (MtG) A card like Stuffy Doll. You choose an opponent, and whenever Stuffy Doll is dealt damage, it deals that much damage to the chosen player. This punishes them for forcing you to attack it.               | (MtG) A card like Goblin Racketeer, which can give an opponent's other, weaker creature the ability that forces you to attack it, allowing you to choose a more favorable forced combat.                                     | (MtG) Playing a "burn" deck. Your primary win condition is dealing direct damage to the opponent's life total with spells, so a creature with a "taunt" effect is strategically irrelevant.                                   | (FaB) An aura like Merciless Gustwave, which prevents heroes from defending with more than one card from their hand, making the "taunt" target much easier to deal with.                                 |
| 10\. Delayed / Inevitable Removal      | (MtG) Using a card like Vampire Hexmage, which can be sacrificed to remove all counters from a target permanent, paying with a creature to save another from "doom counters" or similar effects.          | (Pokémon TCG) Using a Supporter card like Cheryl to heal all damage from your Evolution Pokémon. This is a reactive recovery from accumulated damage-over-time effects before a knockout.           | (MtG) A card like Solemnity, an enchantment that prevents players or permanents from getting counters placed on them, proactively shielding from Infect, -1/-1 counters, or doom counters.                    | (YGO) Destroying the source of the counters, such as the Field Spell A.I.Land, prevents further counters from being placed, slowing the opponent's clock and giving you time to recover.                 | (Pokémon TCG) A Pokémon with an attack like "Vengeful Blast", which does more damage for each prize card your opponent has taken. This punishes them for having advanced their game state by taking KOs.        | (MtG) Using a card like Leeches, which allows you to remove all poison counters from a player and have them draw a card for each counter removed. This redirects the threat from life loss to card draw.                     | (FaB) A rushdown/aggro strategy. Your goal is to win the game through fast, overwhelming damage before the opponent's slow, accumulating threat (like poison counters) can become lethal.                                     | (MtG) A card like The Ozolith, which moves all counters from a creature that leaves the battlefield to itself, then allows you to move them to another creature, corrupting the normal flow of counters. |
| 11\. Scaling / Snowballing Threats     | (MtG) A spell like Dress Down, which you can cast for mana at instant speed to make all creatures lose their abilities, preventing a "whenever X happens, put a +1/+1 counter..." trigger.                | (MtG) Using a single, high-power removal spell like Doom Blade or Terminate to destroy the scaling threat before it can accumulate too many counters and get out of control.                        | (MtG) A creature like Drannith Magistrate, which prevents opponents from casting spells from anywhere other than their hands, shutting down many common ways to start a "snowball" chain.                     | (YGO) A card like Compulsory Evacuation Device, which returns the snowballing monster to the hand, removing all of its accumulated counters/stats and forcing a costly re-deployment.                    | (MtG) A board wipe like Toxic Deluge, where players pay life to give all creatures -X/-X. The player with the larger "snowballing" creatures will often have to pay more life to save them, if possible.        | (YGO) The spell Remove Brainwashing, which returns control of all monsters on the field to their original owners. This can be used to reclaim a monster you gave your opponent that they are now scaling up.                 | (YGO) A "First Turn Kill" (FTK) combo deck. It doesn't matter how large the opponent's monster could get on their turn if they never get a turn to begin with. The engine is simply faster.                                   | (MtG) An enchantment like Damping Sphere, which makes spells cost more for each spell with the same name already cast, directly hampering strategies that scale by casting many cheap, identical spells. |
| 12\. Graveyard / Discard Hate          | (YGO) A card like Emergency Provisions, which allows you to send cards you control to the graveyard to gain Life Points, letting you "pay" to move a key card to safety before an opponent can banish it. | (MtG) Using an instant-speed Entomb effect to put a key creature into your graveyard in response to an opponent casting Rest in Peace, ensuring it's safe before the hate card resolves.            | (FaB) A card like Art of War. It provides proactive value and then is banished. Strategies built around cards that banish themselves are naturally immune to discard pile manipulation.                       | (MtG) A card like Tale's End, which can counter a triggered ability. This can be used to stop the on-enter ability of a Rest in Peace or the activated ability of a Scavenging Ooze.                     | (YGO) The card Exchange, which lets both players see each other's hand and take a card. This can be used to take their key graveyard hate piece before they can play it.                                        | (YGO) Using Transmigration Prophecy to shuffle two cards from any graveyard back into the deck, allowing you to "save" a key card from your opponent's graveyard hate by moving it to a different zone.                      | (MtG) A "living deck" strategy that uses cards with Forecast or Adventure, which operate from zones other than the graveyard (hand, exile), making discard pile hate irrelevant.                                              | (Pokémon TCG) The Stadium card Lost City. It changes the game rules so that all knocked-out Pokémon are sent to the Lost Zone instead of the discard pile, affecting both players' recursion plans.      |
| 13\. Cost Cheating / Fast Deploy       | (MtG) Paying the mana for a spell like Spell Pierce, which counters a non-creature spell unless its controller pays 2 extra mana. This can stop a "reanimation" or "show and tell" effect.                | (YGO) A trap card like Solemn Warning, which can be activated to negate a summon (including a Special Summon from a cost-cheating effect) and destroy the monster.                                  | (YGO) A continuous trap card like Vanity's Emptiness, which prevents any player from Special Summoning monsters. This proactively shuts down most forms of cost cheating in the game.                         | (MtG) A card like Remand, which counters the cheat spell (e.g., Goryo's Vengeance) and returns it to the owner's hand, reversing their tempo and making them spend the mana again next turn.             | (YGO) A card like Maxx "C". When the opponent starts a long chain of special summons to cheat out a big monster, you can activate it to draw a card for every special summon, punishing their combo.            | (MtG) Using Aethersnatch to gain control of the opponent's cheat spell. You get to put their big monster onto the battlefield under your control instead of theirs.                                                          | (MtG) A "prison" deck (e.g., with Ensnaring Bridge). The opponent can cheat a 15/15 Emrakul onto the field, but it can't attack if your hand size is zero, making their threat irrelevant.                                    | (MtG) A card like Grafdigger's Cage, which prevents creatures from entering the battlefield from graveyards or libraries, directly corrupting the battlefield to stop reanimator/cheat strategies.       |
| 14\. Value Engines / Permanents        | (MtG) Using the activated ability of a creature like Caustic Caterpillar. You pay mana and sacrifice it to destroy a target artifact or enchantment (the opponent's value engine).                        | (YGO) Using a quick-play spell like Cosmic Cyclone to banish a problematic Field Spell or Continuous Trap after it has already generated some value for the opponent.                               | (FaB) An equipment piece like Arcanite Skullcap, which has Battleworn and can prevent arcane damage from Wizard value engines turn after turn, so long as you have resources to block.                        | (MtG) An instant like Into the Roil, which you can pay extra for to "bounce" the value engine (e.g., a Planeswalker) back to their hand and also draw a card, creating a tempo and card advantage swing. | (MtG) A card like Bane of Progress, which enters the battlefield and destroys all artifacts and enchantments, punishing every player who relies on these card types, often hitting the engine player hardest.   | (MtG) A spell like Precognitive Perception, which can be used to draw cards instead of its normal effect if you target an opponent, effectively leeching value off of their strategy. (A conceptual stretch for re-routing). | (FaB) Playing a hyper-aggressive hero like Fai. Your goal is to win the game on turn 1 or 2, long before the opponent's slower, permanent-based value engine has a chance to come online and matter.                          | (MtG) A card like Stony Silence, which prevents players from activating abilities of artifacts. This creates an environment where artifact-based value engines are completely turned off.                |
