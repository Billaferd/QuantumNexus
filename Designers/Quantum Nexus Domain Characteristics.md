# **Quantum Nexus Domain and Sub-Faction Identities**

## **Introduction: The Pillars of Strategy and Interaction**

This document is the definitive guide to the core philosophies, mechanical identities, and strategic roles of the six primary Domains in Quantum Nexus. Each Domain represents a unique approach to conflict, with distinct strengths, weaknesses, and a specific narrative flavor. The goal of this document is to be a one-stop shop for all things related to Domain Identity.

A fundamental aspect of this guide is the integration of the **Threat and Counter-Play Interaction Matrix**. This matrix is a core tool for understanding how each Domain's identity translates into its function within the game's ecosystem of threats and answers. Following the matrix, each Domain's description includes a dedicated **"Role in Counter-Play"** section. This section explicitly defines which counter-play strategies from the matrix a Domain excels at, ensuring that every new card designed for a Domain reinforces its established interactive identity and contributes to a healthy, balanced metagame.

## **The Threat and Counter-Play Interaction Matrix**

This matrix provides a systematic analysis of identified strategic and tactical threats within the Quantum Nexus game system. It is the primary design framework for creating balanced and interactive card mechanics, ensuring that for every problem (a "Threat"), there is a rich ecosystem of potential solutions ("Answers").

| Threat (The Problem) | Resource Exchange (Pay to solve it) | Reactive Recovery (Fix it after it happens) | Proactive Shield (Prevent it from happening) | Tempo Reversal (Make them slower) | Symmetrical Punishment (Hurt them more) | Strategic Re-routing (Change the target) | The Inevitable Engine (Present a bigger problem) | Systemic Degenesis (Corrupt the battlefield) | Preparatory Gambit (Bring the right tool) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. "Go-Wide" Aggression** | An Asset with a repeatable, CP-costed ability to inflict minor damage on a quadrant, allowing a player to trade resources for board control. | A high-cost Event (Reality Unravels) that destroys all non-Leader units, serving as a direct answer after the opponent has committed resources. | A Leader or Asset with a passive ability that limits the number of units an opponent can deploy each round. | An Event that increases the CP cost of units with a specific keyword (e.g., Swarm) for a round, disrupting deployment efficiency. | An Event that forces each player to sacrifice units based on the number they control, disproportionately affecting the player with more units. | An effect that forces two of the opponent's units to attack each other, using their board presence against them. | A passive win condition (e.g., an Asset) forces the opponent to shift from attacking the player to dealing with the new, more urgent threat. | A Terrain card that damages non-Domain units within its quadrant, making it costly for the opponent to occupy that space. | Including low-cost, area-of-effect (AoE) removal in a deck or sideboard in anticipation of swarm-based strategies. |
| **2\. "Go-Tall" Threats** | An effect that requires the opponent to pay a CP maintenance cost each round for Upgrades on a unit, taxing their economy. | An Event that destroys all Upgrades on a unit, or one that removes the unit from the game, bypassing its high defensive stats. | An Asset that establishes a maximum Attack value for any single unit on the board, creating a "power ceiling." | An effect that increases the CP cost of the target unit's activated abilities, reducing its action efficiency. | An Event that destroys the unit with the highest combined Attack and Defense, ensuring the "Go-Tall" unit is the target. | An ability that forces the "Go-Tall" unit to attack a non-critical or friendly target, misdirecting its high damage potential. | An alternate win condition can render the "Go-Tall" threat irrelevant if it cannot win the game before the engine's condition is met. | A Terrain that applies a stacking debuff (e.g., \-1/-1) to units in its quadrant, gradually eroding the "Go-Tall" unit's stats. | Including unconditional "hard removal" cards in a sideboard to specifically counter decks built around single, powerful units. |
| **3\. State Application (Static)** | An Upgrade that allows the equipped unit's controller to pay CP to purge a negative state from it. | An Event (System Restore, Absolution) that removes the Static state from one or more units after it has been applied. | A unit or Asset (Acolyte of Reality) that creates a passive aura of immunity, preventing the application of Static on adjacent units. | An effect that returns the source of the Static state to its owner's hand, forcing a re-investment of CP and an action to redeploy it. | An effect that inflicts damage on a player for each of their units affected by a negative state, penalizing them for applying their core mechanic. | A unit ability that allows a negative state to be redirected to an adjacent friendly unit upon application. | An alternate win condition forces the opponent to abandon their "corrupt and purge" strategy to deal with the more immediate game-ending threat. | A Terrain that prevents units within it from being targeted by opponent's effects, creating a safe zone from Static application. | Including state-cleansing cards like System Restore in a sideboard for matchups against Entropy-based decks. |
| **4\. Resource Denial (Hand Attack)** | An Asset (Neural Depository) that allows a player to pay CP to negate a discard effect and draw a card, converting the interaction into a resource trade. | An Event that allows a player to draw cards equal to the number of cards they were forced to discard that round, recovering lost card advantage. | A Leader with a passive ability stating its controller's hand size cannot be reduced by opponent's effects. | An effect that forces the opponent to discard a card whenever they activate a hand attack ability, creating a symmetrical resource loss. | An Asset that forces all players to discard a card whenever any player is forced to discard, creating a global effect. | A unit with an ability that allows it to be deployed for free if it would be discarded by an opponent's effect. | Establishing a dominant board state can make hand attack less relevant, as the opponent must address immediate threats on the board. | A Terrain that prevents players from playing Events, which are the primary source of most hand attack effects. | Including anti-discard cards like Neural Depository in a deck to counter expected hand attack strategies. |
| **5\. Action Denial** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP to "ready" one of their units that was exhausted by an opponent's effect. | An Event that readies all friendly exhausted units, serving as a recovery tool from a mass-exhaustion effect (Psychic Wave). | An Upgrade that grants the equipped unit immunity to being exhausted by opponent's card effects. | An effect that exhausts one of the opponent's units whenever they use an ability to exhaust one of yours, creating a tempo trade. | An Asset that deals damage to each player at the end of the round based on the number of their exhausted units. | A unit with an ability to redirect an exhaustion effect from itself to another friendly unit. | A passive, alternate win condition is unaffected by having its units exhausted, as it does not rely on actions like attacking. | A Terrain that prevents units within its quadrant from being exhausted by card effects, creating a safe staging area. | Sideboarding in "mass ready" effects when anticipating a matchup against Psionics control strategies. |
| **6\. Fortified Positions** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP to move a unit with Territorial, temporarily disrupting the defensive formation. | An Event (Mental Lapse) that reactively removes the defensive keywords from a unit for a turn, creating a window to attack or move past it. | A unit with a passive aura that allows adjacent friendly units to ignore the Territorial keyword. | An effect that prevents a unit from moving back to its original quadrant for a turn after being forcibly moved. | An Event that destroys any unit that did not perform a Move action during the round, punishing static defenses. | An ability that allows a player to swap the positions of one of their units and an opponent's fortified unit. | An alternate win condition operating from the back row can make an opponent's fortified front line strategically irrelevant. | A hazardous Terrain placed in front of the fortification that damages units, making the defensive position costly to maintain. | Including units with the Infiltrator keyword in a deck to bypass defensive lines that rely on controlling deployment zones. |
| **7\. High-Impact Events** | An effect that allows a player to pay CP to force an opponent to discard a card, providing a chance to proactively remove a key Event from their hand. | An Asset (Spawning Pool) that generates value from friendly units being destroyed, allowing for recovery from a board wipe. | An Event (Divine Intervention) that, when played predictively, grants friendly units immunity to destruction by Events for a round. | An effect that increases the CP cost of an opponent's next Event, potentially delaying a board wipe by a crucial turn. | A symmetrical board wipe (Reality Unravels) can be used to reset the board when an opponent has also committed significant resources. | A Magic-based effect that alters the text of an opponent's next Event (e.g., changing "destroy" to "exhaust"). | An alternate win condition that will trigger on the next turn makes an opponent's board wipe irrelevant, as they will lose before they can capitalize on it. | A Terrain with the effect "Events cannot be played," which serves as a hard counter until the Terrain is removed. | Sideboarding in protective cards like Divine Intervention in anticipation of facing control decks that rely on board-wipe Events. |
| **8\. Sticky Units (Zeal)** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP to apply a temporary "keyword blank" effect on a unit before an attack. | A two-stage removal process: a minor attack triggers Zeal and applies Suppressed, followed by a second attack on the now-vulnerable unit. | A unit with an on-attack ability: "The unit damaged by this attack loses all keywords until the end of the round." | An effect that returns the Zeal unit to its owner's hand, forcing a CP and action cost to redeploy it, which is often more efficient than destroying it twice. | An effect that damages a player based on the number of their units that survived combat, punishing the resilience of Zeal. | An ability that allows an attack to bypass the Zeal unit to strike a higher-priority target behind it. | An alternate win condition does not require the destruction of the Zeal unit, making its resilience less relevant to the game plan. | A Terrain applying a stacking defense debuff will eventually reduce the unit's defense to a point where it can be easily destroyed despite Zeal. | Including a low-cost Event with the text "Destroy target Suppressed unit" as a highly efficient counter to the Zeal mechanic. |
| **9\. Forced Engagement (Taunt)** | An Upgrade that allows the equipped unit to pay CP to ignore the Taunt keyword for one attack. | Using a non-attack based removal Event to destroy the Taunt unit, thereby freeing other units to attack their intended targets. | A Leader with a passive aura: "Friendly units are not affected by the Taunt keyword." | An effect that forces the Taunt unit to attack one of its controller's own units, using its mechanic against them. | An effect stating "Whenever a unit attacks, both the attacker and defender take 1 damage," making it costly for the opponent to force an attack into a high-defense unit. | An ability that gives one of the opponent's other, weaker units Taunt, allowing the player to choose the more favorable engagement. | An alternate win condition does not rely on attacking, rendering the Taunt keyword strategically irrelevant. | A Terrain that prevents units from attacking neutralizes both the Taunt unit and potential attackers in that zone. | Including non-attack removal Events in a sideboard to counter Taunt-heavy strategies. |
| **10\. Inevitable Destruction (Impact)** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP to remove Impact counters from a unit, trading resources for survival. | Destroying the source of the Impact before it can apply its effect multiple times. | An Asset that creates a passive "repair" aura, preventing friendly units from having Impact inflicted on them. | An effect that increases the cost of abilities that inflict Impact, slowing the rate at which the opponent can accumulate it. | An effect that reflects Impact back to the source unit's controller. | An ability that allows a player to move Impact counters from a high-value unit to a low-value one, sacrificing one to save the other. | An alternate win condition creates a race: can the opponent stack enough Impact to win before the engine's condition is met? | A Terrain that prevents abilities from being used in its quadrant can shut down the source of the Impact. | Sideboarding in cards that remove negative states or counters if Impact-based strategies are prevalent. |
| **11\. Escalating Threats (Adapt)** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP to prevent a unit's triggered abilities for one turn, enabling an attack without triggering Adapt. | Using a single, high-power attack or a hard removal Event to destroy the Adapt unit in one instance, preventing the trigger. | A Leader with an aura: "Enemy units cannot gain \+1/+1 counters." | An effect that returns the Adapt unit to its owner's hand, which also removes all counters it has accumulated. | An Event that destroys any unit with Attack greater than its printed value at the end of the round, turning the benefit of Adapt into a liability. | An ability that moves the \+1/+1 counters from an opponent's Adapt unit to a friendly unit. | An alternate win condition does not care how large the Adapt unit becomes if it cannot interact with the win condition directly. | A Terrain that prevents units from gaining stat buffs in its quadrant, neutralizing the Adapt keyword. | Including an Event that removes all counters from a unit as a specific counter to Biology's Adapt mechanic. |
| **12\. Recursion Denial (Nullify)** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP to move a card from their discard pile to their deck, protecting it from being removed from the game. | The recovery must be proactive. A player can destroy their own Static-afflicted unit to send it to the discard pile before an attack with Nullify can remove it from the game. | A Leader with a passive ability: "Your cards cannot be removed from the game by opponent's effects." | An effect that returns the unit with Nullify to its owner's hand, preventing it from attacking. | An effect that allows a player to draw a card whenever one of their cards is removed from the game, mitigating the card advantage loss. | An ability that allows a player to swap a card in their hand with a card in their discard pile, saving a key unit from being stranded there. | An alternate win condition that does not rely on discard-pile recursion makes the Nullify keyword irrelevant. | A Terrain with the effect "Units destroyed in this quadrant are returned to their owner's hand," bypassing the discard pile entirely. | Choosing not to run a recursion-heavy strategy if Nullify is a common mechanic in the expected metagame. |
| **13\. Tempo Cheating (Infiltrator)** | An Asset that allows a player to pay CP to deal damage to any unit upon deployment, punishing the Infiltrator as it enters the battlefield. | An Event (Signal Lag) that prevents newly deployed units from declaring an attack for the round. | A unit with a passive ability: "Opponent's units cannot be deployed into their Front Row." This serves as a hard counter to the keyword. | An effect that returns the Infiltrator to its owner's hand, reversing their tempo gain and forcing them to spend the CP and action again. | An Event that destroys any unit that was deployed during the current round at the end of the round. | An ability that forces the Infiltrator to attack a different target than the one its controller intended. | A defensive, alternate win-condition strategy is often well-positioned to deal with a single, isolated threat like an Infiltrator. | A Terrain in the front row that damages any unit that attacks it, making the Infiltrator's attack an unfavorable trade. | Including cards like Signal Lag in a sideboard to specifically counter decks that rely on Infiltrator for early aggression. |
| **14\. Value Engines (Assets)** | An Event that allows a player to pay CP each round to prevent an opponent from using a chosen Asset's abilities. | Using a unit with the Zenithkeyword or an Event that specifically states "Destroy target Asset." | A Leader with a passive ability: "Opponent's Assets have their rule boxes treated as blank." | An Event that increases the CP cost of all Asset abilities for a round, making the engine too expensive to operate efficiently. | An Event that forces each player to sacrifice an Asset, which is highly effective against a player relying on a single, key Asset. | An ability that allows a player to gain control of an opponent's Asset for a turn, using its value engine against them. | An alternate win condition that is faster than the opponent's value engine creates a race to see which engine resolves first. | A Terrain that prevents Assets from being played or their abilities from being used, creating a "dead zone" for such strategies. | Including specific "Destroy target Asset" cards in a sideboard in anticipation of facing Asset-heavy strategies. |

## **Domain 1: Technology**

### **Overall Domain Identity**

**Philosophy:** *"Any variable can be controlled. Any problem can be solved. Any war can be won. You just need the right equation."*

The domain of Technology is built on a foundation of cold, hard logic. Its adherents view the universe not as a place of magic or miracles, but as a complex system governed by physical laws that can be understood, exploited, and ultimately dominated. For them, warfare is a science. Victory is achieved not through passion or luck, but through superior engineering, overwhelming firepower, and flawless logistical execution. They build, they fortify, and they systematically eradicate any opposition with the brutal efficiency of a mathematical proof.

### **Core Characteristics**

* **Excels At:**  
  * **Superior Firepower and Range:** Technology brings bigger guns. Their mastery of ballistics, energy projection, and advanced targeting systems allows them to engage and eliminate threats from well outside the effective range of other domains. They are the masters of **Far Range** combat.  
  * **Area-of-Effect (AoE) Saturation:** Why eliminate one target when you can eliminate a dozen? Technology excels at deploying weapons that saturate entire quadrants of the battlefield with artillery shells, missile barrages, or sweeping energy beams.  
  * **Durable and Fortified Positions:** Their units are forged from hardened alloys and shielded by energy fields. They create resilient board states with high-Defense units, deployable Terrain like automated turrets and bastion walls, and leverage keywords like **Zenith** and **Territorial** to lock down sectors.  
  * **Resource Generation and Efficiency:** A war machine runs on resources. Technology is adept at securing and optimizing their supply lines, represented by their unique ability to gain bonus Command Points (CP) through specialized Assets.  
  * **Upgrades and Modifications:** A piece of tech can always be improved. They are the premier domain for using Upgrade cards, bolting on enhanced armor, larger cannons, and advanced sensor suites to their units.  
* **Struggles With:**  
  * **Reactive Plays and Interrupts:** Their command structure is rigid and relies on executing pre-calculated battle plans. This top-down approach leaves little room for individual initiative, making them unable to use Interrupt abilities and vulnerable to unexpected strategic shifts from more agile opponents.  
  * **Flexibility and Repositioning:** Their war machines are often massive and power-intensive, making them slow and cumbersome. They lack the extra movement keywords common to other domains, meaning a well-planned flanking maneuver can be devastating.  
  * **Targeted Removal of Non-Unit Cards:** Their doctrine focuses on eliminating enemy combatants. They have difficulty efficiently destroying single enemy Assets or Terrain cards without resorting to indiscriminate, wide-area bombardment.  
* **Restricted From:**  
  * **Direct "Hand Attack":** Attacking an opponent's mind or strategy is an illogical and imprecise form of warfare. They cannot force opponents to discard cards.  
  * **"Transformation" Effects:** A machine is what it is. Their units are manufactured, not evolved. They do not change their fundamental nature or become Leaders through mystical means.  
  * **Indiscriminate Global Destruction:** While their AoE is powerful, their logic dictates a focus on efficiency. Wasting energy to destroy everything, including empty terrain, is illogical. They cannot destroy all units on the entire battlefield with a single effect.  
* **Special Skill:**  
  * **Impact:** This keyword represents the slow, grinding, and inevitable destruction wrought by advanced weaponry. It is the hole punched in armor that cannot be repaired, the micro-fractures from a sustained cannon barrage. An enemy might survive the first hit, but the Impact remains, a permanent mark of impending doom.

### **Role in Counter-Play**

Technology's logical and systematic approach to warfare translates into specific methods of counter-play, making them the premier domain for calculated, preventative solutions.

* **Proactive Shield:** This is Technology's primary interactive role. Their mastery of fortifications, high-Defense units, and area denial (*Territorial*) makes them the best at creating durable shields that an opponent must solve before proceeding with their own game plan. An Asset that prevents *Impact* counters from being placed on friendly units is a quintessential Technology shield.  
* **Resource Exchange:** Technology excels at creating answers that involve paying a resource cost for a preventative effect, reflecting their philosophy of calculated problem-solving. An Asset like *Neural Depository* (pay CP to stop a discard) or an Upgrade that allows a player to pay CP to ignore *Taunt* are perfect examples.  
* **The Inevitable Engine:** Technology can present an opponent with a "bigger problem" by building toward a devastating engine. This can be an alternate win condition Asset or the slow, inexorable accumulation of *Impact* counters, forcing the opponent to abandon their own strategy to deal with the more urgent threat.  
* **Preparatory Gambit:** Technology is ideal for designing specific "silver bullet" Upgrades or munitions as sideboard cards to bring in against anticipated threats, such as an Upgrade that grants a unit immunity to exhaustion effects.

### **Technology Sub-Factions**

* **A. Directive (The Architects of Order)**  
  * **Core Identity:** The Directive represents Technology in its purest form: clean, efficient, and utterly dominant. Their aesthetic is one of polished chrome, glowing blue power cores, and unified design language. Every unit is a testament to meticulous planning and industrial perfection. They win by building an unbreachable fortress and then, with chilling precision, dismantling their opponents piece by piece. Their victory is the logical conclusion of a perfectly executed formula.  
  * **Excels At:** Fortification and Area Denial through superior **Territorial** and **Zenith** units, executing flawless Long-Range Bombardment, and being the foremost experts in the methodical application of the **Impact** keyword.  
  * **Struggles With:** Extreme rigidity in strategy. A Directive plan is a masterpiece of logic, but if a variable they didn't account for appears, the entire structure can shatter. They are utterly devoid of reactive plays.  
* **B. Scrapcode (The Jury-Rigged Anarchists)**  
  * **Core Identity:** Scrapcode is innovation born from desperation. Their aesthetic is a chaotic jumble of salvaged parts, exposed wiring, and sparking, unstable power sources. They are the rebels, pirates, and scavengers who create genius from junk. Their creations are often volatile and unpredictable, trading the Directive's durability for explosive, surprising power. They win by overwhelming the enemy with a sudden, violent, and often suicidal flurry of attacks.  
  * **Excels At:** Creating Volatile Chain Reactions where the destruction of their own units triggers devastating explosions. They specialize in High-Risk/High-Reward Upgrades (e.g., '+3 Attack, this unit gains 1 Impact at the start of each round') and Unconventional Mobility via the **Skirmisher** keyword, representing cobbled-together thrusters.  
  * **Struggles With:** Any form of sustained engagement. Their units are fragile, and their strategies are difficult to control, sometimes backfiring spectacularly. They are built for one glorious, explosive turn, not a long war of attrition.

### **Technology Mastery Levels**

* **Level 0:** No access or knowledge of the domain.  
* **Level 1 (Rudimentary):**  
  * **Concept:** Basic machinery and foundational firepower. Simple combustion engines and mass-driver cannons.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to standard Unit cards, simple Upgrades providing static bonuses (e.g., "+1 Attack"), and the **Far Range** keyword.  
* **Level 2 (Adept):**  
  * **Concept:** Tactical positioning and integrated battlefield logistics. Automated factories and supply lines.  
  * **Abilities:** Introduction of space-control keywords like **Territorial**. Access to Assets that generate CP.  
* **Level 3 (Advanced):**  
  * **Concept:** Wielding signature weapons and specialized war-constructs. The first appearance of true energy weapons.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to powerful **Area-of-Effect (AoE)** Saturation Events. The signature **Impact** keyword appears. Specialized **Zenith** units become available.  
* **Level 4 (Absolute Mastery):**  
  * **Concept:** Unleashing the full, devastating power of a technological singularity. Matter-printers, nano-swarms, and planet-cracking weaponry.  
  * **Abilities:** The most powerful AoE effects. Game-ending Leader units that combine multiple keywords. The ability to inflict large amounts of **Impact** in a single volley.

## **Domain 2: Magic**

### **Overall Domain Identity**

**Philosophy:** *"The universe is not a rulebook to be followed, but a canvas to be rewritten. Reality is merely a suggestion."*

Practitioners of Magic are artists and anarchists of reality itself. They see the laws of physics not as immutable truths, but as local customs that can be ignored with sufficient willpower and knowledge. Their power is arcane, esoteric, and unpredictable to the uninitiated. They win not by overpowering their foes with brute force, but by manipulating the very fabric of the battlefield, controlling the flow of combat with potent spells, and creating openings that a more conventional force could never exploit.

### **Core Characteristics**

* **Excels At:**  
  * **Powerful Event Cards:** Magic's strength lies in potent, one-time "spell" effects. These Event cards are their primary weapons, capable of destroying units, altering the board state, or creating powerful, temporary advantages.  
  * **State Manipulation and Debuffs:** They are experts at applying negative states like **Suppressed** through non-combat means, representing curses and enchantments that weaken a foe's body or will.  
  * **Rule Bending:** Their core identity. Magic cards often directly contradict standard game rules, allowing them to do the impossible: ignore targeting restrictions, play cards for free, or even take extra actions.  
  * **Triggered and Activated Abilities:** Their units are often conduits for complex magical energies, featuring versatile non-combat abilities that can be activated to turn the tide of battle.  
* **Struggles With:**  
  * **Physical Durability:** A sorcerer's power is in their mind and their connection to arcane forces, not their physical resilience. Their units generally have lower base Defense values and are easily destroyed in direct combat.  
  * **Consistent Resource Generation:** Magic is a volatile and draining art. They have very few ways to gain bonus CP, making every spell they cast a critical decision.  
  * **Terrain and Fortifications:** The mundane reality of walls and trenches is of little interest to them. Magic is the domain least likely to use or interact with Terrain cards.  
* **Restricted From:**  
  * **Mechanical Upgrades:** The cold logic of machinery is antithetical to the fluid, chaotic nature of magic. They cannot use Upgrade cards.  
  * **Keyword: Impact:** The grinding, physical nature of **Impact** is a crude tool compared to their elegant, reality-altering spells.  
* **Special Skill:**  
  * **Arcane Recall:** A powerful spell is never truly forgotten. This keyword represents a sorcerer's ability to hold the echo of a spell in their mind, allowing them to cast a powerful Event a second time from their Discard Pile, often for a greater cost, before the energy dissipates completely.

### **Role in Counter-Play**

Magic's ability to bend the rules of reality makes it a versatile and powerful source of counter-play, specializing in dramatic, board-altering solutions.

* **Reactive Recovery:** This is Magic's signature interactive style. It excels at fixing a problem *after* it has occurred. Its powerful Events can serve as a "reset button," such as a board wipe like *Reality Unravels* to counter "Go-Wide" aggression, or an Event that removes all Upgrades from a "Go-Tall" threat.  
* **Strategic Re-routing:** The domain's ability to manipulate the fundamental rules of the game allows it to re-route threats in surprising ways. A Magic effect could alter the text of an opponent's next Event (e.g., changing "destroy" to "exhaust") or force a "Go-Tall" unit to attack a friendly target.  
* **Symmetrical Punishment:** The chaotic nature of magic lends itself to powerful, symmetrical effects that can punish an over-committed opponent. An Event that destroys the unit with the highest combined stats or forces both players to sacrifice resources fits perfectly within Magic's identity.  
* **Tempo Reversal:** Magic can disrupt an opponent's efficiency with spells that increase the CP cost of their cards or return key threats to their hand, forcing a re-investment of resources and time.

### **Magic Sub-Factions**

* **A. Artifice (The Weavers of Reality)**  
  * **Core Identity:** Artificers are the architects of the arcane. They don't just cast fleeting spells; they weave permanent enchantments, create self-sustaining magical constructs, and bind spirits into physical forms. Their aesthetic is intricate and beautiful, like a magical tapestry. They win by building an engine of interlocking magical effects that eventually overwhelms the opponent with sheer synergistic power.  
  * **Excels At:** Creating persistent "Enchantment" effects that act as magical upgrades, synergistic buffs that empower their own units, and constructive "Rule Bending" that protects their forces (e.g., "Your units in this quadrant cannot be targeted by Events").  
  * **Struggles With:** Direct, efficient unit removal. Their path to victory is a slow, methodical construction of a magical masterpiece, leaving them vulnerable to early aggression that disrupts their setup.  
* **B. Evocation (The Unravelers of Order)**  
  * **Core Identity:** Entropic mages see magic as the ultimate solvent, a force to deconstruct reality. They believe the purest form of magic is a perfectly aimed bolt of raw, destructive power. Their aesthetic is minimalist and stark; the focus is not on the caster, but on the devastating effect of their spells. They win by blasting away key enemy threats and creating overwhelming tempo swings with powerful, direct Events.  
  * **Excels At:** Powerful, high-impact Event cards that inflict **Impact** or destroy units, widespread **State Manipulation**, and leveraging **Arcane Recall** to reuse their most destructive spells to clear the board.  
  * **Struggles With:** Maintaining any significant board presence. Their units are exceptionally fragile and often exist only to be sacrificed or to provide a brief distraction. They live and die by the power of the spells they can cast from their hand.

### **Magic Mastery Levels**

* **Level 0:** No access or knowledge of the domain.  
* **Level 1 (Rudimentary):**  
  * **Concept:** Simple charms and basic elemental manifestations. A flickering candle flame, a gust of wind.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to fragile units with simple triggered abilities. Straightforward Event cards with minor effects.  
* **Level 2 (Adept):**  
  * **Concept:** Nuanced control and manipulation of battlefield energies. Learning to see and pluck the threads of fate.  
  * **Abilities:** Introduction to **State Manipulation** (e.g., applying **Suppressed**). Simple "Rule Bending" effects appear.  
* **Level 3 (Advanced):**  
  * **Concept:** Casting powerful, flexible spells and tapping into forbidden knowledge. Reciting incantations that make the world tremble.  
  * **Abilities:** The **Arcane Recall** skill appears on key Event cards. Events become more powerful and flexible. Rule Bending becomes more pronounced.  
* **Level 4 (Absolute Mastery):**  
  * **Concept:** Achieving archmage status, capable of reality-warping miracles. Bending time, space, and fate to their will.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to the most powerful Event cards that can alter the entire board state. Rule Bending reaches its apex. High-cost, archmage Leader units with devastating abilities.

## **Domain 3: Psionics**

### **Overall Domain Identity**

**Philosophy:** *"The body is a puppet. The battlefield is a stage. The only thing that is real is the will that controls them."*

The power of Psionics comes from within the mind. Its practitioners view the physical world as a crude suggestion, a "consensus reality" that can be manipulated or bypassed entirely. Their war is fought on a different plane—a battle of wills, thoughts, and perceptions. They win by turning an opponent's strengths against them, dismantling their strategy before it can be enacted, and outmaneuvering them with flawless precognition and misdirection. To fight a Psion is to fight a ghost that can kill you with a thought.

### **Core Characteristics**

* **Excels At:**  
  * **Disruption and Control:** They are the premier domain for controlling enemy units through non-damaging means. They can force units to move, prevent them from acting, or use the **Taunt** keyword to dictate the flow of combat.  
  * **Hand and Deck Manipulation:** They are the only domain that can directly attack an opponent's mind, represented by their ability to force discards from the hand, disrupting the enemy's plans at their source.  
  * **Misdirection and Mobility:** As masters of the **Skirmisher** keyword and other repositioning abilities, they are exceptionally mobile, executing hit-and-run attacks and repositioning with fluid grace.  
  * **Targeted Elimination:** Their attacks are precise, representing a focused psychic lance that can bypass conventional armor or defenses to strike at a weak point.  
  * **Misdirection and Evasion:** As masters of the **Skirmisher** and **Phantom** keywords, they are exceptionally mobile and difficult to pin down, executing hit-and-run attacks and repositioning with fluid grace.  
* **Struggles With:**  
  * **Raw Attack Power:** A psychic assault doesn't always leave a physical mark. Their units generally have lower base Attack values, as their goal is often to neutralize, not obliterate.  
  * **Destroying Non-Unit Cards:** Their powers are focused on living or machine minds. They have almost no way to directly affect inanimate objects like enemy Assets or Terrain.  
  * **Sustained, Long-Range Combat:** Their abilities require focus and proximity. They have very few units with **Far Range**, preferring to get up close and personal.  
* **Restricted From:**  
  * **Direct Attack:** Their Event cards are tools of manipulation, deception, and control, not crude blasts of energy.  
  * **Keyword: Impact:** The physical, grinding nature of **Impact** is irrelevant to a war fought in the mind.  
  * **Resource Generation:** Their power is internal and self-contained; they cannot generate additional CP.  
* **Special Skill:**  
  * **Synaptic Mark (State):** This represents a psychic probe or mental breach that does no harm on its own but leaves a target's mind completely vulnerable to follow-up manipulation. It is the core of the Psionics' calculated, two-step assault. A card afflicted with a **Synaptic Mark** is not affected by the state itself, but can be targeted by powerful Psionics abilities that require its presence.

### **Role in Counter-Play**

Psionics wages war in the mind, making it the premier domain for disrupting an opponent's plans and turning their own strategy against them.

* **Strategic Re-routing:** This is the core of Psionic counter-play. Using keywords like *Taunt* or abilities that force enemy units to attack each other, they turn the opponent's board presence into a liability. An ability that gives one of the opponent's weaker units *Taunt* to create a more favorable engagement is a classic Psionic tactic.  
* **Tempo Reversal:** Psionics excels at slowing the opponent down. Forcing discards to remove key cards, using exhaustion effects to deny actions, or returning an escalating threat like an *Adapt* unit to its owner's hand are all ways Psionics makes an opponent's strategy inefficient.  
* **Reactive Recovery:** While Magic recovers the board, Psionics recovers tempo. An Event that readies all friendly exhausted units serves as a powerful recovery tool from a mass-exhaustion effect, reclaiming lost actions.  
* **Resource Exchange:** The Telepathy sub-faction embodies this by creating a resource battle in the hand. An effect that forces an opponent to discard whenever they activate a hand attack ability creates a symmetrical loss that disrupts their primary plan.

### **Psionics Sub-Factions**

* **A. Telekinesis (The Puppeteers of Matter)**  
  * **Core Identity:** Telekinetics are the "physical" arm of the Psionic domain. They project their will outward to move, shatter, and manipulate the material world. Their aesthetic is one of invisible forces creating visible chaos—units sliding across the board against their will, bullets stopping in mid-air, armor buckling under unseen pressure. They win by controlling the geometry of the battlefield completely.  
  * **Excels At:** Unrivaled mobility with **Skirmisher**, the forced repositioning of enemy units to break formations, and precise attacks that bypass positional defenses like **Territorial**.  
  * **Struggles With:** Any form of resource disruption. Their focus is entirely on the physical board state, and they have no way to attack an opponent's hand or deck.  
* **B. Telepathy (The Breakers of Will)**  
  * **Core Identity:** Telepaths wage war in the enemy's command center. Their warfare is insidious, invisible, and devastating. The aesthetic is subtle—a unit refusing an order, a commander forgetting a crucial plan, a soldier overcome with crippling fear. They win not by destroying an army, but by making that army defeat itself.  
  * **Excels At:** Hand and Deck Manipulation (discard), absolute combat control with **Taunt** and **Phantom**, and forcing enemy actions (exhaustion, forced attacks, preventing card plays).  
  * **Struggles With:** The lowest attack values in the game. Their victory is a slow, creeping corruption of the enemy's ability to fight, and they have no way to deal with inanimate enemy Assets or Terrain.

### **Psionics Mastery Levels**

* **Level 0:** No access or knowledge of the domain.  
* **Level 1 (Rudimentary):**  
  * **Concept:** Basic telepathy and precognitive reflexes. A gut feeling, a lucky dodge.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to units with the **Skirmisher** keyword. Simple abilities that force a random discard.  
* **Level 2 (Adept):**  
  * **Concept:** Exerting direct mental control and creating minor illusions. Planting a suggestion, making someone look left when they should have looked right.  
  * **Abilities:** Introduction of the **Taunt** keyword. The first abilities that apply **Synaptic Mark** appear.  
* **Level 3 (Advanced):**  
  * **Concept:** Deep intrusion into an opponent's mind and strategy. Reading surface thoughts, controlling motor functions.  
  * **Abilities:** The first abilities that exploit a **Synaptic Mark** for a more powerful effect are introduced. More powerful hand manipulation (e.g., targeted discard).  
* **Level 4 (Absolute Mastery):**  
  * **Concept:** Total psychic supremacy, shattering the opponent's will to fight. Rewriting memories, creating armies of puppets, complete mental domination.  
  * **Abilities:** The most powerful forms of disruption (e.g., preventing card plays). Leader units that can lock down multiple enemies. The ability to temporarily take full control of an enemy unit.

## **Domain 4: Divinity**

### **Overall Domain Identity**

**Philosophy:** *"Individuality is a weakness. Strength is found in submission to a higher purpose. Our cause is righteous, and our faith is our shield and our sword."*

The power of Divinity flows from collective belief and unshakable conviction. Its followers are driven by a divine mandate, and their strength comes not from individual prowess, but from synergistic unity and zealous sacrifice. They are an army of true believers, and they win through relentless attrition, overwhelming the enemy with formations of the faithful who are empowered, not stopped, by death, all to pave the way for a divine avatar to deliver final judgment.

### **Core Characteristics**

* **Excels At:**  
  * **Unyielding Resilience:** They are exceptionally difficult to remove from the board, boasting high-Defense units and the **Steadfast** keyword. Their faith makes them immovable objects.  
  * **Summoning and Channeling:** They are masters of bringing forth reinforcements, using **Transformation** effects to turn a humble believer into a divine champion, or summoning units via **Swarm** or directly from the deck/discard pile.  
  * **Performing Rituals:** They can enact powerful, slow-burn abilities that require multiple turns or the sacrifice of their own units to complete, culminating in a game-altering "miracle."  
  * **Synergistic "Go-Wide" Formations:** They master keywords that reward having a large board presence, like the defensive **Phalanx** and the offensive **Horde**.  
  * **Martyrdom (Discard Pile Synergy):** Death is not the end. They leverage their own Discard Pile, with powerful abilities triggering when their units are destroyed.  
* **Struggles With:**  
  * **Card Advantage and Hand Size:** Their strength is in the faithful on the board, not the options in their hand. They have almost no abilities that allow for drawing extra cards.  
  * **Flexibility and Mobility:** Their power comes from rigid, interlocking formations. Their units are typically slow and lack extra movement abilities, making them vulnerable to being outmaneuvered.  
  * **Subtlety and Indirect Interaction:** Their methods are direct and overt. They cannot attack the opponent's hand or deck.  
* **Restricted From:**  
  * **Cost Reduction:** The price of faith is absolute and cannot be discounted. They cannot have effects that reduce the CP cost of their cards.  
  * **Keyword: Infiltrator:** The concept of sneaking behind enemy lines is a tactic for the faithless. They advance as a unified, glorious front.  
  * **Opponent's Discard Pile Interaction:** They are concerned with their own martyrs and their own path to glory, not the fallen of their enemies.  
* **Special Skill:**  
  * **Zeal:** This keyword is the ultimate expression of faith over matter. The first time a unit with **Zeal** would be destroyed each round, its conviction allows it to survive the killing blow, becoming **Suppressed** but remaining on the battlefield to fight another day.

### **Role in Counter-Play**

Divinity's power comes from faith and sacrifice, allowing it to outlast threats and punish attackers through divine judgment.

* **Proactive Shield:** Divinity's unwavering faith manifests as powerful preventative measures. Keywords like *Zeal* and Events like *Divine Intervention* that grant temporary indestructibility serve as powerful shields that are difficult for an opponent to overcome. The *Acolyte of Reality* is a prime example of a protective unit that creates a safe zone.  
* **Reactive Recovery:** With a deep connection to the discard pile through *Martyrdom* and resurrection effects, Divinity excels at recovering from devastating attacks. A mass resurrection Event that returns fallen units from the discard pile allows Divinity to recover from a board wipe that would cripple other domains.  
* **Symmetrical Punishment:** The Infernal sub-faction, in particular, excels at this. They can employ effects that damage players based on the number of units they control (punishing "Go-Wide") or units that survived combat (punishing the resilience of *Zeal*).  
* **The Inevitable Engine:** Divinity's Rituals are a form of inevitable engine. They present a slow but powerful threat that an opponent must address, forcing them to divert resources from their primary game plan to disrupt the ritual before it completes.

### **Divinity Sub-Factions**

* **A. Celestial (The Host of Salvation)**  
  * **Core Identity:** The Celestial host is an embodiment of selfless sacrifice, divine protection, and unyielding faith. Their aesthetic is one of radiant light, angelic wings, and golden armor. They are guardians and martyrs, and they win by becoming an unbreakable wall of faith, weathering any storm until their divine champions can deliver a pure and final victory.  
  * **Excels At:** Unyielding Resilience through **Steadfast**, **Phalanx**, and **Zeal**. Their **Martyrdom** effects are protective (e.g., "When this unit is destroyed, another friendly unit gains \+2 Defense"). Their **Transformations** create powerful angelic guardians.  
  * **Struggles With:** Applying offensive pressure. Their units have low Attack values, and their victory is often a slow, grinding process of outlasting the opponent.  
* **B. Infernal (The Pacts of Damnation)**  
  * **Core Identity:** The Infernal faction derives power from destructive sacrifice and forbidden pacts. Their aesthetic is one of shadow, hellfire, and corrupted iconography. They treat their followers as fuel for a dark engine, consuming their life force to summon powerful demons and overwhelm their enemies in a tide of fanatical, disposable bodies.  
  * **Excels At:** Destructive **Martyrdom** effects that weaponize their own demise (e.g., "When this unit is destroyed, inflict 1 Impact to an enemy unit"). They use aggressive summoning with **Swarm** and **Horde**, and their malevolent **Rituals** sacrifice their own units to summon a single, immense demonic Leader.  
  * **Struggles With:** Resource management. They burn through their own units at a terrifying rate and can be left with nothing if their final, all-in assault is countered. They rely on numbers, not the durability of any single unit.

### **Divinity Mastery Levels**

* **Level 0:** No access or knowledge of the domain.  
* **Level 1 (Rudimentary):**  
  * **Concept:** The faith of a lone zealot and the promise of martyrdom. A single prayer in the darkness.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to units with high base Defense. Simple **Martyrdom** abilities that trigger on death.  
* **Level 2 (Adept):**  
  * **Concept:** The strength of a congregation and unwavering devotion. The power of a choir singing in unison.  
  * **Abilities:** Introduction of synergistic keywords like **Phalanx** and **Horde**. The **Zeal** skill appears.  
* **Level 3 (Advanced):**  
  * **Concept:** Channeling divine power and enacting holy rites. The first true miracles begin to manifest.  
  * **Abilities:** The ability to **Summon** units (**Swarm**, from discard). Access to **Transformation** effects. The ability to perform **Rituals** by sacrificing units.  
* **Level 4 (Absolute Mastery):**  
  * **Concept:** Wielding true, world-altering miracles as the embodiment of a god's will. Becoming a direct avatar for a divine being.  
  * **Abilities:** The most powerful **Transformation** effects. "Miracle" Event cards that can affect the entire board state. The most demanding and impactful **Rituals**.

## **Domain 5: Biology**

### **Overall Domain Identity**

**Philosophy:** *"The only law is hunger. The only truth is growth. All else is simply... the menu."*

The Biology domain represents life unbound and evolution accelerated to a terrifying degree. It is a force of nature driven by a singular, primal imperative: consume, adapt, and multiply. Its adherents do not build machines, pray to gods, cast spells, or read minds; they are the instruments of a biological singularity. They win by overwhelming their foes with a tide of rapidly evolving horrors, corrupting the very battlefield into a toxic extension of their own biology, and turning the biomass of their enemies into the building blocks of their own terrifying propagation.

### **Core Characteristics**

* **Excels At:**  
  * **Reactive Adaptation:** The Biology's core strength is its ability to evolve mid-conflict. Their units grow stronger from being attacked but not destroyed, forcing opponents into all-or-nothing attacks.  
  * **Aggressive Swarming and Propagation:** They can fill the board with numerous, cheap-to-mid-cost units. They uniquely excel at creating new "token" units from the destruction of their foes, turning enemy losses into their own board presence.  
  * **Battlefield Corruption:** They can deploy unique Bio-Terrain that is hazardous to all non-Biology life, creating zones that heal their own units while melting their enemies.  
  * **Debilitating Toxins:** Many of their attacks are laced with corrosive acids or biological agents, allowing them to weaken even the most heavily armored foes before the final kill.  
* **Struggles With:**  
  * **High-Impact "Finisher" Events:** Their power is on the board, in the flesh. They lack the powerful, single-card Events that can reset the board or win the game outright.  
  * **Direct Control:** They cannot manipulate an opponent's hand or directly control enemy units. Their influence is chaotic and predatory, not precise.  
  * **Long-Range Engagement:** As visceral, physical creatures, they need to get close to their prey. They have almost no options for **Far Range** combat.  
* **Restricted From:**  
  * **Mechanical Upgrades:** The concept of bolting on external hardware is incompatible with their purely biological nature.  
  * **Resource Generation:** Their growth is fueled by biomass, not technology. They cannot generate additional CP.  
  * **Discard Pile Recursion:** A fallen Biology creature is just biomass, ready to be reclaimed by the swarm. They cannot return specific, powerful units from their discard pile; they only create new life from the fallen.  
* **Special Skill:**  
  * **Adapt (X):** A unit with **Adapt (X)** has a predatory resilience. The first time it is attacked each round but is not destroyed, its biology goes into overdrive, and you immediately place X \+1/+1 counters on it.

### **Role in Counter-Play**

Biology counters threats by adapting to them, turning the opponent's aggression into a source of strength, and corrupting the environment until it is the only thing that can thrive.

* **Systemic Degenesis:** This is Biology's signature form of counter-play. It excels at creating hazardous Bio-Terrain that damages non-Biology units, turning entire quadrants of the board into death zones that neutralize fortified positions or swarm armies. A Terrain that applies a stacking debuff to enemy units is a perfect example.  
* **The Inevitable Engine:** The *Adapt* keyword is Biology's primary engine. It presents a "bigger problem" by creating an unstoppable "Apex Predator" that grows larger with each failed attack. An opponent must deal with the escalating threat before it becomes too large to handle, distracting from their own win condition.  
* **Symmetrical Punishment:** The Scourge sub-faction can turn the opponent's attacks into a liability. An effect that destroys any unit with Attack greater than its printed value at the end of the round turns the benefit of *Adapt* into a weakness.  
* **Strategic Re-routing:** While less common, Biology can re-route threats by presenting a more tempting or vulnerable target. A *Consume* unit that spawns multiple smaller units can redirect a "Go-Tall" threat's attention away from a more valuable target.

### **Biology Sub-Factions**

* **A. The Scourge (Predatory Evolution)**  
  * **Core Identity:** The Scourge is the Biology as an invasive, cancerous plague. Its purpose is to hunt, consume, and corrupt. Their aesthetic is one of body horror: chitinous armor, dripping acid, and unnatural speed. They are the galaxy's ultimate predators, and they win by swarming their prey in a lightning-fast, hyper-aggressive assault.  
  * **Excels At:** Hyper-aggression using **Skirmisher**, offensive use of **Adapt** on low-defense/high-attack units, and **Consume** abilities that spawn more aggressive token units. Units can be upgraded through an evolution process right on the battlefield.  
  * **Struggles With:** Durability. Scourge units are glass cannons, designed to kill quickly and die spectacularly. If their initial assault is blunted, they have very little staying power.  
* **B. The Verdant Host (Symbiotic Creation)**  
  * **Core Identity:** The Verdant Host is the Biology as a world-creating force of nature. Its purpose is to grow, protect, and assimilate all life into a single, sprawling, interconnected ecosystem. Their aesthetic is one of rampant, alien jungle growth, creatures with bark-like carapaces, and symbiotic organisms. They win by creating an unkillable, self-sustaining board state that slowly smothers the opponent.  
  * **Excels At:** Extreme resilience through defensive use of **Adapt** on high-defense units, synergistic keywords like **Symbiosis** (granting buffs to adjacent units), and creating beneficial Bio-Terrain that heals their own units.  
  * **Struggles With:** Closing out the game. Their units have low offensive stats, and their victory is a slow, methodical process of establishing an unbreakable ecosystem. They lack the high attack values needed to eliminate key threats quickly.

### **Biology Mastery Levels**

* **Level 0:** No access or knowledge of the domain.  
* **Level 1 (Rudimentary):**  
  * **Concept:** Basic survival instincts and simple predatory organisms. A single cell dividing, a lone creature learning to heal.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to simple units with **Adapt (1)**. Introduction to basic **Swarm** mechanics.  
* **Level 2 (Adept):**  
  * **Concept:** The emergence of coordinated hunting and simple ecosystems. The first pack, the first symbiotic bond.  
  * **Abilities:** The **Consume** keyword appears, allowing units to gain benefits from destroying foes. Synergistic keywords that reward having multiple Biology units appear. The first and weakest evolutions begin to appear.  
* **Level 3 (Advanced):**  
  * **Concept:** Weaponized biology and the ability to corrupt the local environment. Growing acid glands, creating toxic spore fields.  
  * **Abilities:** More potent **Adapt (2)** abilities. The ability to deploy hazardous Bio-Terrain. **Consume** abilities can now spawn token units.  
* **Level 4 (Absolute Mastery):**  
  * **Concept:** The creation of apex predators and world-spanning hive-minds. The will of the swarm made manifest.  
  * **Abilities:** The most powerful **Adapt** and **Consume** effects. Game-ending Leader units like "Bio-Titans." Events that grant mass-mutation to your entire board for a turn.

## **Domain 6: Entropy**

### **Overall Domain Identity**

**Philosophy:** *"All signals decay into noise. All code degrades into null. They fight with matter and mind, but we see the truth: the universe is a fading broadcast. We are not its destroyers; we are the inevitable, creeping silence at the end of all things."*

The Entropy domain represents the fundamental principle of dissolution and unmaking. Its adherents perceive reality as a fragile transmission of data that can be corrupted, jammed, and ultimately silenced. They do not win by overpowering their foes, but by systematically corrupting their very identity until they are nothing but meaningless noise, then purging that noise from existence. To fight them is to watch your greatest strengths become garbled, your commands become nonsense, and your very being get de-rezzed from the battlefield.

### **Core Characteristics**

* **Excels At:**  
  * **Data Corruption:** They are the masters of inflicting a debilitating state that nullifies a card's purpose, making it a "blank."  
  * **Targeted Annihilation:** They specialize in abilities that can "purge" corrupted cards, not just destroying them but removing them from the game entirely. Some of their elite units possess the **Nullify** keyword, allowing them to purge **Static**\-afflicted units as a direct result of successful combat.  
  * **Synergistic Removal:** Their core gameplay loop is a two-step process: first, they apply their corrupting **Static** state to a target, and second, they use other abilities to specifically and efficiently purge any card afflicted with **Static**.  
  * **Denial through Noise:** They can play effects that act as "jamming signals," temporarily preventing the use of keywords or activated abilities in a specific area of the board.  
* **Struggles With:**  
  * **Direct Confrontation:** Their units are incredibly weak in terms of raw stats. They are tools for corruption and purging, not for combat.  
  * **Board Presence & Proactivity:** Their strategy is inherently reactive and requires multiple pieces to function (a "corruptor" and a "purger"). This makes them slow and highly vulnerable to early aggression.  
  * **Resource Generation:** They have no way to gain extra CP or draw cards.  
* **Restricted From:**  
  * **High Stats:** They cannot have units with high base Attack or Defense values. Their power is entirely in their abilities.  
  * **Beneficial Effects:** They cannot grant positive keywords, heal, or provide buffs. Their influence is purely negative or neutral.  
  * **Recursion:** The concept of restoring a corrupted or purged file is antithetical to them. They have no interaction with the discard pile.  
* **Special Skill:**  
  * **Static (State):** This is not a keyword on their own units, but a debilitating negative state they apply to others. A card afflicted with **Static** has its rule box treated as blank.

### **Role in Counter-Play**

Entropy counters strategies by deconstructing them, corrupting their identity, and creating universal states of decay that render an opponent's game plan useless.

* **Systemic Degenesis:** While Biology corrupts the physical battlefield, Entropy corrupts the informational layer. It can create "Terrain" with effects like "Events cannot be played" or "Keywords cannot be used," fundamentally changing the rules of engagement in a specific area and creating "dead zones" for certain strategies.  
* **Symmetrical Punishment:** Entropy's philosophy applies to all things, making it a natural fit for symmetrical punishment. An Event that purges any unit with a certain characteristic (e.g., afflicted with *Static*, or having the highest Attack) can be a powerful reset against a player who has established a dominant threat.  
* **Tempo Reversal:** Applying the *Static* state is in itself a form of tempo reversal, as it forces an opponent to deal with a now-useless unit. Furthermore, effects that return the source of *Static* to its owner's hand reverse the opponent's tempo by forcing them to reinvest CP and actions to redeploy their threat.  
* **Reactive Recovery:** Entropy's recovery is unique. It doesn't recover its own board, but it can "recover" from a threat by simply deleting it. Using a **Purge** effect on a "Go-Tall" unit after it has been afflicted with *Static* is Entropy's version of reactive problem-solving.

### **Entropy Sub-Factions**

* **A. The Glitch (The Corrupting Signal)**  
  * **Core Identity:** This sub-faction leans into the informational warfare aspect of the domain. They are the agents of chaos, the masters of signal degradation. Their aesthetic is one of pixelation, corrupted data, and visual noise. They win by rendering the opponent's entire board a useless mess of **Static**\-afflicted units, crippling their strategy at its source before the final purge.  
  * **Excels At:** Efficiently applying the **Static** state to multiple targets. They have abilities that can inflict **Static** on units when they are deployed, when they move, or even as a passive aura. They focus on the setup of the domain's core synergy.  
  * **Struggles With:** The final blow. They have very few abilities that can actually destroy or purge units. Their role is to corrupt the data, but they must rely on their sister sub-faction or incidental attacks to finish the job, making them poor at closing out the game on their own.  
* **B. The Terminus (The Final Deletion)**  
  * **Core Identity:** This sub-faction embodies the erasure aspect of the domain. They are the clean-up crew, the garbage collectors of corrupted data. Their aesthetic is one of clean, minimalist erasure—pure white or black voids where things used to be. They win by methodically and completely purging every corrupted file from the opponent's board, leaving a perfectly silent, empty battlefield.  
  * **Excels At:** Exploiting the **Static** state for total annihilation. They have powerful and efficient abilities that can target and purge any unit with **Static**, often removing them from the game without needing to succeed in an attack.  
  * **Struggles With:** Applying the **Static** state themselves. They are entirely dependent on The Glitch sub-faction or other means to corrupt targets for them. Without a "corruptor," their powerful "purge" abilities have no valid targets, rendering them useless.

### **Entropy Mastery Levels**

* **Level 0:** No access or knowledge of the domain.  
* **Level 1 (Rudimentary):**  
  * **Concept:** A brief flicker in the signal. A single corrupted data packet.  
  * **Abilities:** Access to simple Event cards that can treat a single unit's rule box as blank for one turn.  
* **Level 2 (Adept):**  
  * **Concept:** The ability to inject persistent, low-level noise into the system.  
  * **Abilities:** Introduction of the **Static** state. First abilities that can apply **Static** to a single target as an action.  
* **Level 3 (Advanced):**  
  * **Concept:** Mastering the synergy of corruption and deletion.  
  * **Abilities:** More efficient ways to apply **Static** appear. Powerful abilities that can purge a **Static**\-afflicted unit from the game are introduced.  
* **Level 4 (Absolute Mastery):**  
  * **Concept:** Becoming the embodiment of informational entropy; a walking "delete" command for reality.  
  * **Abilities:** The most powerful corruption and purging effects. The ability to apply **Static** to multiple units at once. Leader units with devastating abilities that might purge any unit that gains the **Static** state anywhere on the board.
