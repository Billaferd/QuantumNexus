### **Quantum Nexus: Mission Card Creation Guidelines**

> Note to the ReaderThis is the Quantum Nexus: Mission Card Creation Guidelines. This document is not meant to explain any rules that a player would need; it is solely intended to aid designers in creating captivating and interesting Mission Cards for Quantum Nexus. Players are welcome to read this document, but please know that these guidelines are not applied to any in-game scenario; they are solely intended for use in the design and creation of Mission Cards for Quantum Nexus. This document is meant to be used in conjunction with the "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines" and the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules."

### **I. Introduction**

Welcome to the "Quantum Nexus: Mission Card Creation Guidelines." Mission Cards are a unique and pivotal component of Quantum Nexus, serving as a player's strategic blueprint, a primary source of roundly Command Points (CP), and a core component of deck identity. This document guides designers in crafting Mission Cards that are balanced, thematic, and integrate seamlessly with the core game mechanics and design philosophies of Quantum Nexus.

#### **A. Core Design Principles**

When designing Mission Cards, designers must adhere to the fundamental principles that govern Quantum Nexus:* **Card Control:** Each player retains complete ownership and control of their cards throughout the game. Players are not allowed to touch any other player's cards, even if an effect they control affects an opponent's card.

* **Clarity and Precision:** Card text must be unambiguous. Use precise keywords and phrasing consistent with the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules."

* **Strategic Depth:** Mission Cards should encourage meaningful strategic choices, both in deck construction and during gameplay. They should define a deck's identity without making it overly linear.

### **II. Anatomy of a Mission Card**

A Mission Card is composed of several key elements, each serving a specific function. Understanding these components is the first step in designing a balanced and engaging card.

* **Card Title:** A thematic and evocative name.

* **Domain Points (DP):** Values assigned to the six domains (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity, Biology, and Entropy). These are critical for deck construction rules.

* **Printed CP Value:** The number of Command Points this card contributes to the player's roundly CP calculation.

* **Inherent Passive Ability:** An ability that is active from the very start of the game.

* **Challenge:** A specific objective the player must complete during the game.

* **One-Time Reward Ability:** A powerful, single-use ability that is unlocked only upon completing the Challenge.

* **Art and Flavor Text:** Visual and narrative elements that enrich the card's identity.

### **III. The Six Domains**

The six domains are the thematic and mechanical pillars of Quantum Nexus. Each Mission Card is assigned points across these domains, which directly impacts deck construction.

* **Technology:** Represents advanced science, cybernetics, and machinery.

* **Magic:** Encompasses arcane arts, enchantments, and raw elemental forces.

* **Psionics:** Focuses on mental powers, telekinesis, and psychic phenomena.

* **Divinity:** Involves faith, divine intervention, and holy or unholy power.

* **Biology:** Focuses on biomass, evolution, and the creation of life.

* **Entropy:** Represents dissolution, corruption, and inevitable decay.

A player's chosen set of six Mission Cards must have a total of exactly 6 Domain Points distributed among them, with no single domain exceeding 4 points. These totals set the legality for all Unit cards in the player's deck.

### **IV. The Role of Domain Points in Design**

Domain Points (DP) are the foundational element of Mission Card balancing. The total number of DP assigned to a Mission Card determines its overall power level and "design space." A higher DP total allows for more impactful abilities or a higher Printed CP value.The DP value on a Mission Card serves as a direct indicator of its strategic weight and thematic commitment. It signals the level of power and complexity the card's abilities can manifest, all within the philosophical boundaries defined for each domain in the main "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines." Designers must balance a card's DP allocation with its desired abilities and CP value, ensuring that a card with high DP in a sought-after domain feels appropriately powerful and influential.

### **V. Core Functions and Design Goals of Mission Cards**

Mission Cards are multifaceted. When designing one, it is crucial to understand the distinct roles it plays in the game.* **Victory Condition:** Completing all chosen Mission Cards is a path to victory ("Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section VI.B).

* **Deck Construction Definition:** The chosen set's total Domain Points per domain define the DP caps for Unit cards ("Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section II.C).

* **Command Point (CP) Generation:** Each Mission Card has a printed CP value. The sum of these from all chosen Mission Cards forms the base for the player's CP calculation each Start of Round Step ("Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Sections II.B, III.C.1.a.ii).

* **Inherent Strategic Effect (Passive Ability):** Each Mission Card has an ongoing Passive Ability that is active from the start of the game. This ability helps define a player's strategic direction and provides a persistent benefit.

* **Strategic Objective (Challenge):** Each Mission Card presents a unique "Challenge" the player must achieve to unlock a significant reward.

* **Reward for Completion (One-Time Ability):** Completing a Challenge unlocks a powerful, one-time ability for an immediate, impactful effect.

### **VI. Designing the Challenge**

The Challenge is the heart of a Mission Card's gameplay experience. It should be an engaging objective that requires skillful play and strategic commitment to achieve.

#### **A. Crafting a Good Challenge**

- **Clarity:** The conditions for completion must be unmistakable and easy to track.

- **Synergy:** The Challenge should align thematically and mechanically with the card's domain(s) and abilities. It should feel like a natural goal for a deck built around that Mission's identity.

- **Interactivity:** The best Challenges encourage interaction with the opponent and the board state, rather than passive, "solitaire" play. They should push the player to engage in the core mechanics of the game.

- **Appropriate Difficulty:** The difficulty of the Challenge is a key lever in the card's overall balance. A more difficult or demanding Challenge should justify a more powerful Reward Ability or a higher Printed CP value. The difficulty should scale with the Mission Card's total DP.

### **VII. Designing Mission Card Abilities (Inherent & Reward)**

Mission Cards feature two distinct types of abilities: the Inherent Passive Ability, which is always active, and the One-Time Reward Ability, which is earned by completing the Challenge.

#### **A. Inherent Passive Ability**

The Passive Ability is an innate feature of the Mission Card, active from the beginning of the game. It should provide a subtle but meaningful strategic direction, nudging the player towards the playstyle embodied by the card's domains. Its power level should be modest and reflect the "always-on" nature of the benefit.

#### **B. Reward Ability (One-Time)**

Upon completing a Mission Card's Challenge, the player is granted access to a new, powerful One-Time ability. This ability should feel like a significant payoff for their effort. It typically triggers and resolves once, immediately upon Challenge completion, providing a major tempo swing or strategic advantage that aligns with the card's Domain philosophy.

#### **C. Aligning Abilities with Domain Philosophy**

The power, complexity, and nature of both the Passive and Reward abilities **must** be designed in accordance with the Domain Philosophy and Progression tables outlined in Section IV of the "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines." A Mission Card with 3 DP in Technology should have abilities that feel like "Advanced Infrastructure," while a card with 1 DP in Psionics should have effects that feel like "Basic ESP." This qualitative alignment is the core of balancing Mission Card abilities.

### **VIII. Mission Card Balance Framework â€“ The Qualitative Approach**

To ensure every Mission Card is balanced, designers must use a qualitative, holistic approach. This framework revolves around the principle that a card's total impact on the game must be justified by its costs and conditions, guided by the established Domain Philosophies.

#### **A. Balancing Levers**

Designers have four primary levers to adjust when balancing a Mission Card:1) **Domain Points (DP):** The total DP value determines the card's overall power budget. Higher DP allows for more potent abilities and a greater influence on the game.

2) **Challenge Difficulty:** A more demanding or difficult Challenge acts as a cost to the player, justifying a stronger reward or a higher base CP value.

3) **Ability Power (Passive & Reward):** The combined impact of the always-on Passive ability and the game-swinging One-Time Reward ability is the core of the card's power. Their strength must be appropriate for the card's DP level.

4) **Printed CP Value:** This is the final balancing lever. A Mission Card that offers very powerful abilities or has a very easy Challenge might provide fewer roundly CP. Conversely, a card with a highly demanding Challenge or more subtle abilities might provide more CP to compensate.

#### **B. The Balancing Process**

Follow these steps to design a balanced Mission Card:1. **Establish the Concept & Domains:** Start with a clear thematic and strategic concept. Assign Domain Points that reflect this concept.

2. **Consult the Domain Philosophy:** Refer to the "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines" (Section IV). Use the descriptions of strengths, weaknesses, and DP progression to define the _types_ of effects the card can have.

3. **Design the Abilities & Challenge:**- Craft a **Passive Ability** that provides a small, thematic benefit appropriate for the card's DP.

    - Design a **Challenge** that tests a player's commitment to the card's strategy. Its difficulty should feel proportional to the reward.

    - Create a **One-Time Reward Ability** that is a powerful and satisfying payoff, representing a high-level expression of the card's Domain(s).4. **Holistic Assessment & CP Assignment:** Step back and evaluate the card as a whole.- Does the power of the reward justify the difficulty of the Challenge?

    - Is the constant benefit of the Passive ability accounted for?

    - How much does this card warp a player's strategy?

    - Based on this holistic assessment, assign a **Printed CP Value**. There is no formula; it is a judgment call based on the card's total package. A card that provides immense strategic advantage through its abilities should provide less raw resource (CP), while a card that is harder to complete or offers a less game-defining advantage can provide more.5. **Iterate and Playtest:** The final step is rigorous playtesting. Adjust the four levers (DP, Challenge, Abilities, CP Value) based on feedback to achieve the perfect balance.

#### **C. CP Value Baseline Framework**

While the final Printed CP Value of a Mission Card is a judgment call based on its total package, designers must use the following baseline framework to guide that decision. This framework ensures that a Mission's ongoing resource contribution (CP) is appropriately scaled to its deckbuilding commitment (DP). A card's abilities and challenge difficulty can then adjust this baseline value up or down.

| **Mission Total DP** | **Thematic Role** | **Recommended CP Range** | **Design Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 DP                 | Flexible "Splash" | 2-3 CP                   | A 1 DP mission should not be a primary CP engine. Its low deckbuilding cost offers maximum flexibility, so its resource contribution must be minimal to maintain balance. A designer may justify a 4 CP value if the mission's abilities are exceptionally weak or its Challenge is unusually difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2 DP                 | Core Synergy      | 3-4 CP                   | These missions form the backbone of a strategy and should provide a solid, average CP base. A mission with a powerful passive might sit at 3 CP, while one with a more situational passive could be at 4 CP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3 DP                 | Faction Pillar    | 4-5 CP                   | A 3 DP mission represents a significant commitment and should be rewarded with a slightly above-average CP value to compensate for the reduced deckbuilding flexibility. This is the sweet spot for powerful, synergistic missions central to a faction's identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4 DP                 | Keystone          | 5-6 CP                   | As the maximum commitment to a single domain, these missions should provide the highest base CP values to reward the player for their specialization. This high CP value is justified because the player has sacrificed strategic flexibility. Conversely, a 4 DP mission with a game-winning reward (like the one demonstrated in the "Psionic Citadel" example) might be assigned a very low CP value (1-2 CP), as its power is derived from its abilities, not its resource generation. |**Adjusting the Baseline:** A designer can move a card's CP value outside this recommended range, but they must provide explicit justification based on the other balancing levers. For instance, a mission with an exceptionally easy Challenge or an overly powerful Passive Ability should have its CP value reduced from the baseline to compensate.

### **IX. Mission Card Creation Example: "Psionic Citadel"**

### This section provides a practical, step-by-step example of creating a Mission Card using the qualitative framework.

#### **Phase 1: Concept and Foundation**

### * **Concept:** A mission that rewards a player for establishing a dominant, controlling board presence using Psionics, locking down the opponent's options through mental force rather than brute strength.

* **Assign Domain Points:** The concept is pure Psionics. We want it to be a cornerstone strategy, so a high DP value is appropriate.- Technology: 0 DP

- Magic: 0 DP

- Psionics: 4 DP

- Divinity: 0 DP

- Biology: 0 DP

- Entropy: 0 DP

- **Total DP: 4**

#### **Phase 2: Design and Philosophy**

### * **Consult Domain Philosophy:** With 4 DP in Psionics, we are at the "Psionic Supremacy" level. The philosophy calls for "Total command of the battlefield through sheer force of will." Strengths are combat manipulation, information warfare, and "soft" control. Weaknesses are poor non-unit interaction and a lack of brute force or CP generation.

* **Card Feel Axes:**- Malevolence: Neutral/Benevolent. It's about control, not outright destruction.

- Utility: Disruptive. Its goal is to shut down the opponent's game plan.

- Combat: Defensive. It wins by preventing the opponent from fighting effectively.

- Impact: Constructive/Destructive. It constructively builds your control while destructively dismantling the opponent's strategy.

#### **Phase 3: Design the Gameplay Elements**

### * **Inherent Passive Ability:** This should be a small, constant benefit that aligns with the theme. "Psionic Supremacy" involves controlling the board.* **Passive Ability:** "Enemy units in a quadrant _adjacent_ to one of your 'Psionic' subtype units cannot be moved by their controller."

* **Rationale:** This is a classic "soft control" effect that functions within the game rules by affecting adjacent quadrants. It's not overwhelmingly powerful on its own, but it helps establish the lockdown theme from turn one and synergizes with the Challenge. It directly reflects the Psionics domain's strengths.* **The Challenge:** The challenge should be a clear demonstration of "Psionic Supremacy." It needs to be difficult and require significant board control.* **Challenge:** "At the end of your turn, if you control at least one 'Psionic' unit in three different friendly quadrants, and your opponent controls two or fewer ready units, complete this mission."

* **Rationale:** This is a multi-faceted and difficult challenge. It requires you to spread your forces wide (three quadrants), maintain your Psionic theme, AND successfully suppress the opponent's board (two or fewer ready units). This is a true test of control.* **One-Time Reward Ability:** The reward for achieving such a dominant state must be game-winning. It should be the ultimate expression of Psionic control.- **One-Time Reward Ability:** "Immediately, for the rest of the game, enemy units lose all keywords and their rule boxes are treated as blank while they are in a quadrant adjacent to a friendly 'Psionic' unit."

- **Rationale:** This is an incredibly powerful, game-altering lockdown. It doesn't destroy units (respecting the Psionics weakness of lacking brute force), but it neutralizes almost any complex threat, turning the opponent's army into vanilla bodies. This is the epitome of "Psionic Supremacy."

#### **Phase 4: Holistic Assessment and Finalization**

* **Assessment:** This Mission Card is extremely powerful. The passive provides a useful annoyance, the challenge is very difficult but defines a clear win condition, and the reward is potentially game-ending against many strategies. The card is a "build-around" that a player must dedicate their entire deck to.

* **Assign Printed CP Value:** Because the potential power of the reward is so high, the card itself should not provide a large amount of base resources. It forces the player to win through its abilities, not by out-resourcing the opponent. A low CP value is appropriate.- **Printed CP Value: 2 CP

**Final Card Template:**

|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Card Title              | Psionic Citadel                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Domain Points           | Tech: 0, Magic: 0, Psionics: 4, Divinity: 0, Biology: 0, Entropy: 0                                                                                                                    |
| Printed CP Value        | 2 CP                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Passive Ability         | Enemy units in a quadrant adjacent to one of your 'Psionic' subtype units cannot be moved by their controller.                                                                         |
| Challenge               | At the end of your turn, if you control at least one 'Psionic' unit in three different friendly quadrants, and your opponent controls two or fewer ready units, complete this mission. |
| One-Time Reward Ability | Immediately, for the rest of the game, enemy units lose all keywords and their rule boxes are treated as blank while they are in a quadrant adjacent to a friendly 'Psionic' unit.     |

### **X. Keywords and Mission Cards**

Keywords can appear on Mission Cards, typically as part of their abilities. When a keyword is used, its impact on the game must be factored into the holistic assessment of the ability's power level. A powerful, game-defining keyword will significantly increase the "cost" of an ability, which must be balanced by adjusting the other levers (Challenge difficulty or Printed CP).

### **XI. Playtesting and Iteration for Mission Cards**

No amount of qualitative balancing can replace rigorous playtesting. Once a Mission Card has been designed using this framework, it must be tested to evaluate its real-world impact.Focus feedback on:

* **Challenge:** Is it clear? Is the difficulty appropriate for the reward? Is it fun and interactive to pursue?

* **Inherent Passive Ability:** What is its impact on early-game strategy and overall game flow? Does it feel like a fair, constant benefit?

* **Reward Ability (One-Time):** Is it a satisfying and compelling reason to pursue the Challenge? Is its power level balanced?

* **Printed CP Value:** Does the roundly CP feel appropriate given the Challenge difficulty and the power of the abilities? Does the Mission Card feel like a valuable strategic choice compared to others?

* **Overall Balance:** How does the mission compare to others? Does it promote diverse strategies or create unintended exploits?

### **XII. Supporting Documentation**
