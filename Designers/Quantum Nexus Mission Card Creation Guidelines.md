# Quantum Nexus: Mission Card Creation Guidelines

**Note to the Reader**

This is the Quantum Nexus: Mission Card Creation Guidelines. This document is not meant to explain any rules that a player would need; it is solely intended to aid designers in creating captivating and interesting Mission Cards for Quantum Nexus. Players are welcome to read this document, but please know that these guidelines are not applied to any in-game scenario; they are solely intended for use in the design and creation of Mission Cards for Quantum Nexus. This document is meant to be used in conjunction with the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines (CCG v2.0)," and the "Quantum Nexus: Ability Creation Guidelines (ACG)."

## I. Introduction

Welcome to the "Quantum Nexus: Mission Card Creation Guidelines." Mission Cards are a unique and pivotal component of Quantum Nexus, serving as a player's strategic blueprint, a primary source of roundly Command Points (CP), and one of the paths to victory. This document guides designers in crafting Mission Cards that are balanced, thematic, and integrate seamlessly with the core game mechanics and design philosophies of Quantum Nexus.

### A. Core Design Principles

When designing Mission Cards, designers must adhere to the fundamental principles that govern Quantum Nexus:

* **Card Control:** Each player retains complete ownership and control of their cards throughout the game. Players are not allowed to touch any other player's cards, and a player's cards are not allowed to leave that player's designated play areas (Battlefield quadrants, Loadout Area, Discard Pile, Deck, Hand, Mission Card Area). This aligns with Section V.F of the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules."
* **Predictable Gameplay:** The only random elements in Quantum Nexus are initial card shuffles and the card draw during the Start of Round Step. This design choice eliminates luck-based mechanics like dice rolls, coin flips, or other random elements not inherent to card effects, ensuring that strategic decision-making and tactical planning are the primary factors that determine the outcome of battles.
* **Streamlined Combat:** Units in Quantum Nexus do not have health points. Their resilience is represented by a Defense value. When a Unit is attacked, its Defense is compared to the attacker's Attack value. The outcomes are specific and defined in Section III.C.2 of the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules":
    * If Attack (A) > Defense (D): The defending unit is destroyed.
    * If A = D: The defending unit becomes **Suppressed** (it exhausts).
    * If A < D: The attacking unit becomes **Disordered** (-1 Defense until its controller's next Start of Round Step) and is **Pushed Back**.

## II. Understanding the Game Environment for Mission Design

While Mission Cards themselves are not deployed onto the Battlefield like Units or Terrain, their challenges and rewards will often interact with game elements defined in the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules" and "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines (CCG v2.0)." Designers must be familiar with:

### A. Battlefield Structure

The Quantum Nexus battlefield for each player consists of a 3x2 grid of six quadrants (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Back Left, Back Center, Back Right). Units are always deployed into their controller's own quadrants and never physically enter an opponent's play area or quadrants. A player's Front Row is considered to face each opponent's Front Row for targeting purposes. (See "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section V.E and V.F).

### B. Range Types

Unit abilities and attacks use defined ranges: **Close, Mid,** or **Far**. The precise definitions for these ranges are found in the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules" (Section VIII: Glossary) and referenced in the "Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines (CCG v2.0)" (Section II.B). Challenges and rewards on Mission Cards may involve or be affected by these ranges when they concern Units.

### C. Movement

Unit movement is a specific single action ("Move a Unit") taken during a player's turn in the Activation Sequence. It involves moving a ready Unit one quadrant in a cardinal direction to an adjacent friendly quadrant within their own Battlefield, after which the Unit becomes exhausted. (See "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section III.C.2).

### D. Internal Design Tags (Formerly "Card Ranks")

The terms Terrestrial, Aerial, Orbital, and Interstellar are internal thematic tags for designers and do not appear as player-facing mechanics dictating deployment or rules (See CCG v2.0, Section II.D). Card deployment is determined by its type (e.g., Units to their owner's Battlefield quadrants, Assets to their owner's Loadout Area).

### E. Game Round Structure

Quantum Nexus gameplay proceeds in **Game Rounds**, each consisting of a **Start of Round Step** and an **Activation Sequence**.

1.  **Start of Round Step:** Simultaneous for all players. Includes deactivating exhausted cards, gaining Command Points (CP) for the round (derived primarily from Mission Cards), and drawing cards up to five. Triggered abilities then resolve. (See "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section III.C.1).
2.  **Activation Sequence:** Players take turns performing single actions (Deploy a Card, Activate an Active Ability, Declare an Attack, Play an Event Card, Move a Unit, or Pass) in clockwise order until all players consecutively pass. (See "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section III.C.2).

* **Initiative:** Determines the first player to act in the Activation Sequence. (See "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section III.D).

Mission Card challenges and abilities must be designed to function cohesively within this Game Round structure.

---

## III. Interfacing with Card Types and Subtypes

Mission Card challenges and rewards will frequently interact with the various card types defined in Section IV of the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules." Designers should ensure this interaction is consistent with current card type functionalities:

* **Units:** The primary combatants, deployed to their owner's Battlefield quadrants. Possess Attack, Defense, and potentially a Range.
    * **Leaders:** A subtype of Unit with specific deployment restrictions (one per player per their own quadrant) and deck construction limits (max 25 CP of Leaders per main deck).
* **Upgrades:** Attach to a player's own Units or Assets to modify them.
* **Assets:** Deployed to a player's Loadout Area, providing persistent effects or abilities. Have Defense but no inherent Attack.
* **Events:** Played as a single action during the Activation Sequence for an immediate one-time effect, then typically discarded.
* **Terrain:** Deployed into a player's own quadrants, providing inherent defensive bonuses and other effects. Max two Terrain per player per their own quadrant.
* **Subtypes:** Many cards can have subtypes (e.g., "Mech," "Drone," "Spell") which provide thematic and mechanical hooks for abilities and challenges.

---

## IV. The Domain System and Mission Cards

The four domains—Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity—are central to Quantum Nexus, influencing card identity, abilities, and crucially, deck construction via Mission Cards.

### A. Domain Characteristics (Thematic Guidance)

* **Technology:** Themes of advanced machinery, ranged weaponry, area effects, and battlefield control.
* **Magic:** Themes of versatile spellcasting, arcane power, enchantments, and direct unit interaction.
* **Psionics:** Themes of mind control, telekinesis, psychic manipulation, and mental assaults.
* **Divinity:** Themes of blessings, curses, holy/unholy power, and large-scale interventions.

*(Designers can refer to CCG v2.0, Section IV.B and ACG, Section IV.C for more detailed discipline lists.)*

### B. Mission Cards and Domain Points (DP) – Player-Facing Rules Summary

As per the "Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules" (Section II.B and II.C):

1.  A player chooses a set of Mission Cards (maximum of six).
2.  This chosen set must collectively have **exactly 6 total Domain Points** distributed among the four domains.
3.  Across this chosen set, no single domain (e.g., Technology) can have **more than 4 total points**. (0 points in a domain for the set is allowed).
4.  The collective Domain Point totals from this set dictate Unit card inclusion: a Unit card's DP for any given domain must be equal to or lower than the player's total Mission DP for that same domain.

### C. Domain Points – Individual Mission Card Design Constraints (Designer Guideline)

To ensure individual Mission Cards are balanced and contribute reasonably to a player's set:

1.  Each Mission Card must be assigned **at least 1 Domain Point** in total.
2.  Each Mission Card should typically have a **maximum of 4 Domain Points** in total, distributed across one or more domains. *(This helps ensure no single mission over-saturates the DP contribution for a small set of missions).*

---

## V. Core Functions and Design Goals of Mission Cards

Mission Cards are multi-faceted, serving critical roles in gameplay:

1.  **Victory Condition:** Completing all chosen Mission Cards is a path to victory ("Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section VI.B).
2.  **Deck Construction Definition:** The chosen set's total Domain Points per domain define the DP caps for Unit cards ("Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Section II.C).
3.  **Command Point (CP) Generation:** Each Mission Card has a printed CP value. The sum of these from all chosen Mission Cards forms the base for the player's CP calculation each Start of Round Step ("Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules," Sections II.B, III.C.1.a.ii).
4.  **Strategic Objectives (Challenges):** Each Mission Card presents a unique "Challenge" the player must achieve.
5.  **Rewards for Completion:** Completing a Challenge typically unlocks a one-time ability and an ongoing passive ability.

**Design Goals for Mission Cards:**

* **Uniqueness & Strategic Diversity:** Offer distinct challenges, abilities, and themes.
* **Balanced Progression:** Vary challenge difficulty and reward scaling to create interesting gameplay arcs.
* **Thematic Cohesion:** Align Challenge, DP, printed CP, and rewards with the Mission's overall theme and narrative.

## VI. Designing Mission Card Challenges

The "Challenge" is the objective of a Mission Card. Its "cost" in terms of Design Budget (DB) points (`Challenge_Cost_DB`) is a key input into the Mission Card Balance Framework (see Section VIII). This cost is derived from discrete DB values for its constituent parts, as defined in a dedicated section of the Master DB Cost List(s).

### A. Nature of Challenges

* Challenges must be clear, specific, and verifiable game states or achievements.
* They should require active player effort, strategic choices, or specific deck-building considerations.
* Avoid challenges solely reliant on opponent actions or pure luck beyond standard game randomness.
* **Construction:** Challenges are broken down into logical components (e.g., "Control X [Unit Type] in Y Location on your Battlefield for Z turns"). Each component (type of control, number, location, duration, specific actions required) will have a DB cost specified in the **"Master DB Cost List for Challenge Components."** The sum of these component costs forms the `Challenge_Cost_DB`.
    * *Examples of Challenge Aspects to Cost:*
        * Requiring specific card types, subtypes, or domains to be in play/used on the player's side.
        * Requiring control of specific quadrants or board configurations on the player's Battlefield.
        * Requiring actions to be taken a certain number of times by the player.
        * Requiring a state to be maintained by the player's cards for a duration.
        * Requiring specific interactions with an opponent's cards (e.g., "Destroy X opponent's Units of Y type, which are located in the opponent's quadrants on their side of the Battlefield").

### B. Challenge Pacing (Conceptual)

The complexity and DB cost of a Challenge will naturally influence its pacing:

* **Lower `Challenge_Cost_DB` Challenges:** Simpler, achievable early, suitable for modest rewards or missions with higher Printed CP.
* **Higher `Challenge_Cost_DB` Challenges:** More complex, require more setup or specific conditions, suitable for gating more powerful rewards or missions with lower Printed CP.

### C. "Negative" Challenges (Self-Imposed Hurdles)

These Challenges require the player to achieve a state normally considered detrimental (e.g., "Have X or more cards in your Discard Pile," "Have had X friendly Units destroyed this game").

* Such challenges would have a **negative `Challenge_Cost_DB`** on the Master List, reflecting that the player is accepting a drawback. This negative cost, when used in the formula in Section VIII, will increase the `CP_Budget_DB`, potentially leading to a higher Printed CP value for the Mission Card.

### D. Thematic Integration and Narrative

Challenges should align thematically with the Mission Card's concept and can be enriched by narrative elements from the Quantum Nexus universe.

---

## VII. Designing Mission Card Rewards (Abilities)

Upon completing a Mission Card's Challenge, players are typically rewarded with new capabilities, commonly a One-Time ability and a Passive ability.

### A. Ability Construction using the Ability Creation Guidelines (ACG)

All abilities granted by Mission Cards (both One-Time and Passive) **must be designed and described** using the component system (Effects, Targets, Triggers, Conditions) and catalogues (ACG Appendices E-H) found in the "Quantum Nexus: Ability Creation Guidelines."

### B. Reward Power via Design Budget (DB) Points (Reward\_Abilities\_DB)

The power level of reward abilities is quantified by their total conceptual **Design Budget (DB) cost**, determined using the ACG principles and the official **Master DB Cost List for Abilities**. This sum is referred to as `Reward_Abilities_DB` and is a key input for the Mission Card Balance Framework (see Section VIII).

* A higher `Reward_Abilities_DB` indicates a more powerful reward package.

### C. Types and Timing of Reward Abilities

1.  **One-Time Ability:** Typically triggers and resolves once, immediately upon Challenge completion. Its effect should be impactful for that moment.
2.  **Passive Ability:** Becomes active after Challenge completion. Its trigger (e.g., "At the start of each of your Game Rounds," or continuously active) and duration must be clearly defined in its ability text, designed per ACG.

* Abilities can provide resource advantages, board presence changes (respecting card control rules), card manipulation, enhancements, or disruptions.

## VIII. Mission Card Balance Framework – The Intrinsic Budget System (Version 2)

This framework details the "Mission Card Intrinsic Budget System," designed to determine a Mission Card's **Printed CP Value** by treating the Mission Card as having its own internal Design Budget (DB) derived from its characteristics. This budget, combined with a delta assessment of its Challenge and Rewards, determines its roundly CP generation. This system aims for objective costing by utilizing discrete DB values from the (forthcoming) Master DB Cost List(s) for its components.

**Key System Parameters (To be Calibrated by the Design Team):**

* **`DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor`:** DB points granted to `TDB_Mission` per DP on the Mission Card (e.g., **10 DB per DP** – placeholder).
* **`FDB_Mission` (Foundational Design Budget for Missions):** A flat DB base for all missions (e.g., **5 DB** – placeholder).
* **Master DB Cost List for Challenge Components:** A new, critical list detailing DB costs for various types and complexities of challenge objectives.
* **`Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier`:** The DB cost for a Mission Card to provide 1 Printed CP per round (e.g., **4 DB per 1 Printed CP** – placeholder).
* **Rounding Rules & Min/Max Printed CP values** (e.g., minimum 1 or 2 Printed CP).

**Balancing Steps:**

**Phase 1: Calculate Total Design Budget for the Mission (TDB_Mission)**

1.  **Step 1: Define Domain Point (DP) Allocation**
    * The designer assigns Domain Points (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity) to the Mission Card.
    * *Designer Constraint:* Each individual Mission Card must have 1 to 4 total DP assigned and at least 1 DP in one domain.

2.  **Step 2: Calculate `TDB_Mission`**
    * `DDB_Mission = (Total DP on this Mission Card) * DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor`
    * `TDB_Mission = FDB_Mission + DDB_Mission`
        * *Example: A Mission Card with 3 DP, FDB_Mission = 5 DB, DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor = 10 DB/DP:*
            * `DDB_Mission = 3 * 10 DB = 30 DB`
            * `TDB_Mission = 5 DB + 30 DB = 35 DB`

**Phase 2: Costing the Mission's Core Features in DB**

3.  **Step 3: Calculate Challenge Cost (Challenge\_Cost\_DB)**
    * Design the Mission's Challenge (see Section VI).
    * The Challenge is broken down into its constituent logical and conditional components. Each component is assigned a DB cost from the dedicated **"Master DB Cost List for Challenge Components."**
    * Sum the DB costs of all components to get `Challenge_Cost_DB`.
        * *Example: If the total `Challenge_Cost_DB` for a moderately complex challenge sums to 12 DB.*
    * A "Negative Challenge" (detrimental to player) would have a negative `Challenge_Cost_DB`.

4.  **Step 4: Calculate Reward Abilities Cost (Reward\_Abilities\_DB)**
    * Design the One-Time and Passive reward abilities (see Section VII) using the ACG.
    * Sum their DB costs (obtained from the official Master DB Cost List for Abilities) to get `Reward_Abilities_DB`.
        * *Example: One-Time Ability = 7 DB, Passive Ability = 8 DB. Then `Reward_Abilities_DB = 15 DB`.*

**Phase 3: Determine Printed CP Value**

5.  **Step 5: Calculate Adjusted Budget for CP Generation (CP\_Budget\_DB)**
    * This step incorporates the `TDB_Mission` and the delta between the Challenge cost and Reward cost.
    * `CP_Budget_DB = TDB_Mission + (Challenge_Cost_DB - Reward_Abilities_DB)`
        * *Example (continuing from above):*
            * `TDB_Mission = 35 DB`
            * `Challenge_Cost_DB = 12 DB`
            * `Reward_Abilities_DB = 15 DB`
            * `CP_Budget_DB = 35 DB + (12 DB - 15 DB) = 35 DB + (-3 DB) = 32 DB`

6.  **Step 6: Calculate Preliminary Printed CP Value**
    * `Preliminary Printed CP = CP_Budget_DB / Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier`
        * *Example: If `CP_Budget_DB = 32 DB` and `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier = 4 DB` (cost for providing 1 CP per round):*
            * `Preliminary Printed CP = 32 DB / 4 DB = 8 CP`

7.  **Step 7: Finalize Printed CP Value (Rounding & Iterative Adjustment)**
    * Round the `Preliminary Printed CP` according to established design team rules (e.g., round to the nearest whole number, with a typical minimum of 1 CP or 2 CP for any Mission Card).
        * *Example: 8 CP is a whole number. This is a high value for a single mission. This outcome results from the chosen placeholder values for TDB inputs and the `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier`. Designers must use these outputs to assess if the inputs (DP, Challenge/Reward DB costs) are appropriate or if system parameters like the multiplier need calibration for typical CP outcomes. If 8 CP is too high, `CP_Budget_DB` needs to be lower.*
    * **Iterative Balancing is Key:**
        * **If Calculated Printed CP is Too Low (e.g., below minimum threshold):** The `CP_Budget_DB` is insufficient. To increase Printed CP, designers must increase `CP_Budget_DB` by:
            1.  Increasing `TDB_Mission` (e.g., by increasing its assigned DP).
            2.  Making the delta `(Challenge_Cost_DB - Reward_Abilities_DB)` more positive by:
                * Increasing `Challenge_Cost_DB` (make the Challenge more "expensive" in DB / more difficult).
                * Decreasing `Reward_Abilities_DB` (make the completion abilities less powerful/costly in DB).
        * **If Calculated Printed CP is Too High (e.g., above a practical maximum like 5 or 6 CP):** The `CP_Budget_DB` is too large. To decrease Printed CP, designers must decrease `CP_Budget_DB` by:
            1.  Decreasing `TDB_Mission` (e.g., by decreasing assigned DP).
            2.  Making the delta `(Challenge_Cost_DB - Reward_Abilities_DB)` more negative by:
                * Decreasing `Challenge_Cost_DB` (make Challenge "cheaper" / easier).
                * Increasing `Reward_Abilities_DB` (make rewards more powerful/costly in DB).
    * The goal is a Printed CP Value that ensures the Mission Card is a balanced strategic option.

**Self-Balancing Aspect:**
This system is designed to be self-balancing. Designer choices for a Mission Card's DP (affecting `TDB_Mission`), the DB cost of its Challenge, and the DB cost of its Rewards will directly influence the `CP_Budget_DB`, which in turn determines the roundly Printed CP it provides.

**Importance of Master DB Cost Lists:**
The objectivity of this system heavily relies on comprehensive and well-calibrated **Master DB Cost Lists**, including the standard list for abilities and the crucial new section for **Challenge Components.**

### IX. Mission Card Creation Example: "Nexus Alignment Protocol"

This section provides a step-by-step example of designing a Mission Card, "Nexus Alignment Protocol," using the principles outlined in these guidelines, including the "Mission Card Intrinsic Budget System" (Section VIII) and the component-based ability design from the "Ability Creation Guidelines (ACG)."

**Disclaimer on DB Costs:** All Design Budget (DB) point values used in this example are **illustrative placeholders** intended to demonstrate the costing process. Official design work must use the calibrated values from the **Master DB Cost List(s)** (including the forthcoming list for Challenge Components and the established list for Abilities).

**Step 1: Conceptualize the Mission Card**

* **Name:** Nexus Alignment Protocol
* **Theme:** Achieving a specific, stable board presence and high resource level, representing an alignment with powerful Nexus energies.
* **Domain Points (DP) Allocation:**
    * Technology: 2 DP
    * Magic: 0 DP
    * Psionics: 2 DP
    * Divinity: 0 DP
    * *Total DP = 4*
* **Card Feel (Intended):**
    * Malevolence: Neutral
    * Utility: Utility-focused
    * Combat: Neutral
    * Impact: Constructive
* **Challenge Concept:** Simultaneously control units across the entire front row of your Battlefield while having a significant CP reserve at the start of a round.
* **One-Time Reward Concept:** Immediate resource boost (CP and cards).
* **Passive Reward Concept:** Improved card selection/draw quality.

**Step 2: Calculate Total Design Budget for the Mission (TDB_Mission)**
(Using placeholder system parameters from Section VIII: `FDB_Mission = 5 DB`, `DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor = 10 DB/DP`)

* `DDB_Mission = (Total DP: 4) * (DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor: 10 DB) = 40 DB`
* `TDB_Mission = (FDB_Mission: 5 DB) + (DDB_Mission: 40 DB) = 45 DB`

**Step 3: Design and Cost the Challenge (Challenge\_Cost\_DB)**

* **Challenge Text:** "At the start of your Game Round, if you control at least one friendly Unit in each of your three Front Row quadrants on your Battlefield, AND you have 10 or more CP in your current CP pool, this mission is completed."

* **Breakdown and Illustrative DB Costing for Challenge Components:**
    *(These would draw from a "Master DB Cost List for Challenge Components." The rationale for each placeholder DB cost is provided for clarity.)*
    1.  **Trigger for Check:** "At the start of your Game Round" (ACG App G.II.A)
        * Notes: This is a standard, once-per-round timing for the check. The *check itself* has a small overhead.
        * *Illustrative DB for "Challenge Check Window: Start of Round":* `0.5 DB`
    2.  **Condition 1 (Board Presence):** "you control at least one friendly Unit in each of your three Front Row quadrants on your Battlefield"
        * This is a complex condition involving multiple simultaneous states.
        * Condition 1a: Control a Unit in your Front Left Quadrant (ACG App H.II.D - Card Location; H.III.B - Player Control)
            * *Illustrative DB:* `1.5 DB` (Controlling a specific area type)
        * Condition 1b: Control a Unit in your Front Center Quadrant
            * *Illustrative DB:* `1.5 DB`
        * Condition 1c: Control a Unit in your Front Right Quadrant
            * *Illustrative DB:* `1.5 DB`
        * Conjunction: "AND" for these three sub-conditions (ACG App H.IV - Boolean)
            * *Illustrative DB for specific multi-part positional AND:* `1.0 DB` (Cost increases for needing all simultaneously)
        * *Subtotal for Board Presence condition:* `1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.0 = 5.5 DB`
    3.  **Condition 2 (Resource Level):** "you have 10 or more CP in your current CP pool" (ACG App H.III.A - Player Resources; H.IV - Comparison)
        * Notes: "10 or more CP" is a significant reserve to maintain.
        * *Illustrative DB for "Player CP >= 10":* `3.0 DB`
    4.  **Overall Conjunction:** The main "AND" connecting Condition 1 (Board Presence) with Condition 2 (Resource Level).
        * *Illustrative DB for "Top-Level AND of complex conditions":* `0.5 DB`

* **Total `Challenge_Cost_DB`:** `0.5 DB (Trigger Window) + 5.5 DB (Board Presence) + 3.0 DB (Resource Level) + 0.5 DB (Overall Conjunction) = 9.5 DB`

**Step 4: Design and Cost the Reward Abilities (Reward\_Abilities\_DB)**

* **A. One-Time Reward Ability:**
    * **Ability Text:** "Immediately gain 3 CP. Then, draw 2 cards."
    * **Breakdown & Illustrative DB Costing (from ACG/Master List for Abilities):**
        * Trigger: "Immediately upon mission completion" (Implicit for One-Time Mission Rewards, often bundled into their nature)
            * *Illustrative DB for "Mission Completion One-Time Trigger":* `0.5 DB`
        * Effect 1: "Gain 3 CP" (ACG App E.II.A)
            * Target: Player (Self) (ACG App F.II) - usually `0.0 DB` for self.
            * *Illustrative DB (using ACG App E example of 4.5 DB per CP gained):* `3 * 4.5 DB = 13.5 DB`
        * Effect 2: "Draw 2 cards" (ACG App E.II.B)
            * Target: Player (Self) (ACG App F.II) - `0.0 DB`.
            * *Illustrative DB (using ACG App E example of 4.0 DB per card drawn):* `2 * 4.0 DB = 8.0 DB`
    * *Total DB for One-Time Ability:* `0.5 DB (Trigger) + 13.5 DB (CP Gain) + 8.0 DB (Card Draw) = 22.0 DB`

* **B. Passive Reward Ability:**
    * **Ability Text:** "At the start of your Game Round, after you draw cards for the round, you may look at the top card of your deck. If you do, you may place that card on the bottom of your deck."
    * **Breakdown & Illustrative DB Costing (from ACG/Master List for Abilities):**
        * Trigger: "At the start of your Game Round, after you draw cards for the round" (ACG App G.II.A - specific timing)
            * *Illustrative DB:* `1.0 DB`
        * Effect ("you may look at the top card of your deck"): Optional Information Gain + Deck Scrying (ACG App E.II.C)
            * Part 1: "Look at the top card of your deck"
                * Target: Top card of own Deck (ACG App F.I.C) - `0.0 DB`.
                * *Illustrative DB for "Look at 1 top card":* `0.5 DB`
            * Part 2: "If you do, you may place that card on the bottom of your deck" (Conditional action on choice, minor deck filtering)
                * *Illustrative DB for "Optional bottom-decking of viewed card":* `0.75 DB`
    * *Total DB for Passive Ability:* `1.0 DB (Trigger) + 0.5 DB (Look) + 0.75 DB (Optional Bottom) = 2.25 DB`

* **Total `Reward_Abilities_DB`:** `22.0 DB (One-Time) + 2.25 DB (Passive) = 24.25 DB`

**Step 5: Calculate Adjusted Budget for CP Generation (CP\_Budget\_DB)**
(Using formula from Section VIII: `CP_Budget_DB = TDB_Mission + (Challenge_Cost_DB - Reward_Abilities_DB)`)

* `TDB_Mission = 45 DB`
* `Challenge_Cost_DB = 9.5 DB`
* `Reward_Abilities_DB = 24.25 DB`
* `Delta = Challenge_Cost_DB - Reward_Abilities_DB = 9.5 DB - 24.25 DB = -14.75 DB`
* `CP_Budget_DB = 45 DB + (-14.75 DB) = 30.25 DB`

**Step 6: Calculate Preliminary Printed CP Value**
(Using placeholder `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier = 4 DB` from Section VIII)

* `Preliminary Printed CP = CP_Budget_DB / Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier`
* `Preliminary Printed CP = 30.25 DB / 4 DB = 7.5625 CP`

**Step 7: Finalize Printed CP Value (Rounding & Iteration)**

* Rounding: `7.5625 CP` would likely round up to **8 CP** (assuming standard rounding: .5 and up rounds up).
* **Assessment:** A Printed CP of 8 is very high for a single mission, especially if players typically use 3-4 missions to reach a total CP pool of 15-18 for their 6 total Mission DP. This outcome is a direct result of the chosen placeholder values (high `TDB_Mission` from 4DP, strong rewards, relatively "cheap" challenge in DB, and a low `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier`).
* **Potential Iterations for Designers (to achieve a Printed CP likely in the 3-5 range for this type of mission):**
    1.  **Increase `Challenge_Cost_DB`:** Make the challenge significantly harder. For instance, requiring all three front-row units to be of specific subtypes or domains, or maintaining the state for multiple rounds, would increase its DB cost.
    2.  **Reduce `Reward_Abilities_DB`:** The One-Time ability is very potent. Reducing it to "Gain 1 CP. Draw 1 card." might bring its DB cost from 22 DB down to (0.5 + 4.5 + 4.0) = 9 DB. This would make `Reward_Abilities_DB = 9 + 2.25 = 11.25 DB`.
        * *Recalculating with this change:* Delta = 9.5 - 11.25 = -1.75 DB.
        * `CP_Budget_DB = 45 + (-1.75) = 43.25 DB`.
        * Printed CP = 43.25 / 4 = 10.8 CP. This went the wrong way, making Printed CP even higher because the rewards became much "cheaper" than the challenge, increasing the positive delta added to `TDB_Mission`. The formula `TDB_Mission + (Challenge - Reward)` means if Reward gets smaller, the `(Challenge - Reward)` delta gets larger (or less negative), increasing `CP_Budget_DB`.
    3.  **Corrected Iteration Logic for User's Formula `TDB_Mission + (Challenge - Reward)`:**
        To *reduce* Printed CP (because 8 CP is too high), we need to *reduce* `CP_Budget_DB`. This means:
        * Decrease `TDB_Mission` (e.g., use fewer Mission DP).
        * Make the `(Challenge_Cost_DB - Reward_Abilities_DB)` delta smaller or more negative. This is achieved by:
            * Decreasing `Challenge_Cost_DB` (easier challenge).
            * Increasing `Reward_Abilities_DB` (stronger rewards).
        * *This seems counter-intuitive if we think stronger rewards should mean *less* roundly CP. The formula implies that if a mission's TDB is fixed, and its challenge becomes easier relative to its rewards, the mission must provide less ongoing CP. If its challenge is harder relative to its rewards, it provides more ongoing CP.*
        * Let's re-run with `Reward_Abilities_DB` increased to 30 DB (very strong rewards) and `Challenge_Cost_DB` kept at 9.5 DB:
            * Delta = 9.5 - 30 = -20.5 DB
            * `CP_Budget_DB = 45 + (-20.5) = 24.5 DB`
            * Printed CP = 24.5 / 4 = 6.125 CP (rounds to 6 CP). Still high, but lower.
        * Let's try `Challenge_Cost_DB` = 5 DB (easier) and `Reward_Abilities_DB` = 30 DB:
            * Delta = 5 - 30 = -25 DB
            * `CP_Budget_DB = 45 + (-25) = 20 DB`
            * Printed CP = 20 / 4 = 5 CP. This is getting into a more typical range.
    4.  **Re-Calibrate System Parameters:** As noted before, the global parameters like `DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor` and especially `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier` are the most powerful levers for the design team to adjust average Printed CP outcomes across all missions. If the `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier` was higher (e.g., 10 DB), then a `CP_Budget_DB` of 20 DB would yield 2 Printed CP.

This iterative process is essential. The example highlights how initial placeholder DBs can lead to outcomes needing adjustment to fit the desired game balance.

**Step 8: Complete the Mission Card Template**

* **Name:** Nexus Alignment Protocol
* **Printed CP Value:** **5 CP** (Assuming iteration from the 8 CP initial calculation, by making the Challenge easier and/or rewards slightly more potent in DB terms, or adjusting TDB, to hit this more typical target. This is an *illustrative final value after hypothetical iteration*.)
* **Domain Points:** Technology: 2, Psionics: 2 (Total: 4 DP)
* **Card Feel Axes:** Malevolence: Neutral; Utility: Utility-focused; Combat: Neutral; Impact: Constructive
* **Challenge:** "At the start of your Game Round, if you control at least one friendly Unit in each of your three Front Row quadrants on your Battlefield, AND you have 10 or more CP in your current CP pool, this mission is completed."
    * *(Internal Note: Illustrative `Challenge_Cost_DB` after iteration might be, for example, 5.0 DB if simplified)*
* **One-Time Ability (Upon Completion):** "Immediately gain 2 CP. Then, draw 1 card."
    * *(Internal Note: Illustrative `DB Cost` after iteration might be, for example, 0.5 + 2*4.5 + 4.0 = 13.5 DB)*
* **Passive Ability (After Completion):** "At the start of your Game Round, after you draw cards for the round, you may look at the top card of your deck. If you do, you may place that card on the bottom of your deck."
    * *(Internal Note: Illustrative `DB Cost` = 2.25 DB. Total Reward DB = 13.5 + 2.25 = 15.75 DB)*
    * *(Recalculating with these iterated illustrative values: `TDB_Mission = 45 DB`. `Challenge_Cost_DB = 5.0 DB`. `Reward_Abilities_DB = 15.75 DB`. Delta = 5.0 - 15.75 = -10.75 DB. `CP_Budget_DB = 45 + (-10.75) = 34.25 DB`. Printed CP = 34.25 / 4 = 8.56 CP -> rounds to 9 CP. This shows how sensitive it is; getting to exactly 5CP requires precise DB values or system calibration.)*
    * **Let's assume for the template we stick to the initially calculated values and note the iteration need:**
* **Printed CP Value:** **8 CP** *(From initial calculation, subject to balance iteration to target a lower value like 3-5 CP by adjusting input component DBs or system parameters).*
* **Challenge:** "At the start of your Game Round, if you control at least one friendly Unit in each of your three Front Row quadrants on your Battlefield, AND you have 10 or more CP in your current CP pool, this mission is completed." *(Internal: Illustrative `Challenge_Cost_DB` = 9.5 DB)*
* **One-Time Ability (Upon Completion):** "Immediately gain 3 CP. Then, draw 2 cards." *(Internal: Illustrative `DB Cost` = 22.0 DB)*
* **Passive Ability (After Completion):** "At the start of your Game Round, after you draw cards for the round, you may look at the top card of your deck. If you do, you may place that card on the bottom of your deck." *(Internal: Illustrative `DB Cost` = 2.25 DB)*
* **Flavor Text:** "Order begets power. Power begets understanding. Understanding begets alignment."
* **Image Description:** A holographic interface displays three energy conduits converging from different points on a stylized battlefield map towards a central, glowing nexus symbol. Abstract psionic energy patterns and technological data streams flow along the conduits. The background shows a serene, high-tech observation deck overlooking a vast nebula.
* **Faction:** Unaligned Scholars of the Nexus (Illustrative)

This detailed example demonstrates the methodical process intended for designing and balancing Mission Cards, emphasizing the breakdown of Challenges and Abilities into costed components.

## X. Card Design Aesthetics and Thematic Development

### A. Card Feel
Mission Cards should evoke a specific "feel" using the Card Feel Axes (Malevolence, Utility, Combat, Impact) defined in CCG v2.0 (Section V.A). The Challenge, abilities, printed CP, Domain Point allocation, and overall theme should align to create this cohesive feel.

### B. Developing a Mission Card Theme
A strong theme enhances immersion and guides design.
1.  **Choose a Core Theme:** Align with Quantum Nexus domains, factions, characters, or narrative events.
2.  **Brainstorm Keywords/Concepts:** Identify terms and ideas that capture the theme's essence.
3.  **Translate to Mechanics:** Design the Challenge and reward abilities to reflect the theme. Ensure the Mission Card's printed CP and DP allocation also feel appropriate for the theme.
4.  **Narrative Integration:** Connect the mission to the game's lore where possible.
5.  **Refine and Iterate:** Review for consistency, engagement, and balance.

## XI. Playtesting and Iteration for Mission Cards

Rigorous playtesting is crucial. Focus feedback on:

* **Challenge:** Clarity, perceived difficulty versus its `Challenge_Cost_DB`, engagement, strategic impact.
* **Reward Abilities:** Impact, satisfaction, balance (compared to `Reward_Abilities_DB`), clarity, fun factor.
* **Printed CP Value:** Does the roundly CP feel appropriate given the Challenge and Rewards? Does the Mission Card feel like a valuable strategic choice in a set of missions?
* **Overall Balance:** How does the mission compare to others? Does it promote diverse strategies? Are there unintended exploits or overly dominant combinations?

**Iterative Balancing:** Based on feedback and the Mission Card Balance Framework (Section VIII), designers must be prepared to adjust:
* The **Challenge** design (and thus its `Challenge_Cost_DB`).
* The **Reward Abilities** (and thus their `Reward_Abilities_DB`).
* The Mission Card's **Domain Point** allocation (which affects `TDB_Mission`).
* And through these, the resulting **Printed CP Value**.
* System parameters like `DP_Mission_Valuation_Factor` or `Roundly_CP_DB_Multiplier` may also need calibration by the lead design team based on broad playtesting trends.

The goal is a balanced, engaging, and strategically interesting set of Mission Cards.

## XII. Supporting Documentation and Appendices

This document focuses on the unique aspects of Mission Card creation. For the design of abilities granted by Mission Cards, and for general card creation principles, designers **must** refer to:

* **"Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules":** For all core game rules, mechanics, and definitions.
* **"Quantum Nexus: Card Creation Guidelines (CCG v2.0)":** For general card design principles, the Progressive Budget Build system, Card Feel, and other card type specifics.
* **"Quantum Nexus: Ability Creation Guidelines (ACG)":** Essential for:
    * The methodology of constructing abilities (Effects, Targets, Triggers, Conditions).
    * **ACG Appendix E: Core Game Effects Catalogue**
    * **ACG Appendix F: Core Game Targets Catalogue**
    * **ACG Appendix G: Core Game Triggers Catalogue**
    * **ACG Appendix H: Core Game Condition Types Catalogue**
* The official **Master DB Cost List(s)** (to be developed and maintained by the design team): These will provide the definitive Design Budget (DB) point values for all ability components, keywords, and crucially for Mission Cards, **Challenge Components.** These lists are essential for objective costing within this framework.
