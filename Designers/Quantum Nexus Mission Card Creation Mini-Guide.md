## Creating Quantum Nexus Mission Cards: A Mini-Guide

The sources offer a detailed framework for designing mission cards, which are crucial for shaping strategy and determining resource availability in Quantum Nexus. Here's a step-by-step guide for creating a mission card:

**1. Domain Expertise: Laying the Foundation**

*   Mission cards represent your specialization in the Quantum Nexus universe. You achieve this specialization by allocating Domain Points (DP) among Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. 
*   Each mission card must have a minimum of 1 DP and a maximum of 4 DP in total across all domains.
*   The DP distribution on your mission cards dictates the maximum domain values allowed on other cards in your deck.  For example, if a mission card has 3 DP in Technology, you cannot use unit cards with a Technology value exceeding 3 in a deck that includes that mission card.
*   The total DP across all domains on all the mission cards in your deck must equal exactly 6.
*   No single domain on a mission card can exceed 4 DP.
*   You are allowed to have 0 DP in a domain on a mission card.

**2. Base CP: Calculating Your Starting Resources**

*   The total DP on the mission card determines the initial CP pool for that card. 
*   Multiply the total DP assigned to the mission card by 3 to calculate the Base CP: `BaseCP = Domain Points (DP) * 3`.

**3. Challenge: Testing Your Strategic Prowess**

*   Each mission card has a unique challenge that players must strive to complete to unlock the card's abilities.
*   Use the **Difficulty Scale** to determine a preliminary CP cost for the challenge based on how demanding it is:
    *   **Level 1 (1-3 CP):** Simple, achievable within a turn.
    *   **Level 2 (4-6 CP):** More involved, may require specific card combinations or short-term goals.
    *   **Level 3 (7-9 CP):** Complex, may require specific synergies or sustained board control.
    *   **Level 4 (10-12 CP):** Difficult, may span multiple turns or impose drawbacks on the player.
    *   **Level 5 (13+ CP):** The most challenging, may require long-term planning or significant drawbacks.
*   Apply a **Domain Point Modifier** to the challenge's CP cost based on the mission card's DP distribution to account for domain strength:
    *   **+1 CP:** If the challenge aligns with a 4 DP domain on the mission card.
    *   **0 CP:** If the challenge aligns with a 2-3 DP domain on the mission card.
    *   **-1 CP:** If the challenge aligns with a 1 DP domain on the mission card.
*   Consider various types of challenges: Domain-Specific, Generic (not tied to any specific domain), Resource Management, Deck Manipulation, Battlefield Control.
*   Think about **Challenge Pacing:** Early-Game (easy, achievable in the first few turns), Mid-Game (more setup required), Late-Game (difficult, may require multiple turns).
*   **Negative Challenges** are also an option. These require the player to perform an action that has a detrimental effect on their own game state, increasing the Adjusted CP of the mission card.

**4. Abilities: Reaping the Rewards**

*   Completing a mission's challenge unlocks two abilities:
    *   **Passive Ability:** An ongoing effect that triggers at the start of each of your turns after completing the challenge.
    *   **One-Time Ability:** A potent effect that triggers immediately upon completing the challenge.

*   The strength of both abilities scales with the difficulty of the challenge and the total DP on the mission card.

**5. Adjusted CP: Balancing the Equation**

*   The Adjusted CP represents the final CP value of the mission card, taking into account the challenge CP cost and the CP costs of the abilities.
*   Add the preliminary challenge CP cost (from step 3) to the Base CP (from step 2).
*   Determine the combined CP cost of the abilities you've designed.
*   Use the following formula to calculate the Adjusted CP: `Adjusted CP = Base CP + (Challenge CP - (Ability CP * Sign(Challenge CP)))`.
*   **Important:** The Adjusted CP of a mission card cannot be less than 0.
*   **Example:** If your mission card has a Base CP of 9, a Challenge CP of 5, and abilities with a combined CP cost of 8, the Adjusted CP would be 6.
*   Remember that you can manipulate the Adjusted CP by adjusting the costs of the challenge and the abilities. For example, a higher Challenge CP combined with lower Ability CP will result in a higher Adjusted CP, making the mission card more challenging to complete but potentially more rewarding.

**6. Playtesting and Iteration: The Key to Balance**

*   Playtesting is crucial for ensuring that your mission card is balanced, fun to play, and fits seamlessly into the Quantum Nexus gameplay experience.
*   Gather feedback from playtesters and be prepared to adjust CP costs, modify challenge requirements, or refine ability effects to achieve the desired level of balance.

**Additional Tips**

*   **Card Feel:** Consider how the mission card's challenge and abilities can evoke a specific card feel (Malevolent, Benevolent, Utility, Combat, Impact) to enhance thematic consistency.
*   **Theme:** Develop a cohesive theme for your mission card by choosing a core concept and brainstorming related keywords. Translate the theme into the mechanics of the challenge and abilities.
*   **Narrative Integration:**  Weave the mission card's theme and mechanics into the lore of Quantum Nexus, referencing historical events, factions, or characters.
*   **Presentation:** Use the provided Mission Card Template to present your card's information clearly and concisely.

By following this guide and utilizing the resources provided in the sources, you can create compelling mission cards that enrich the Quantum Nexus universe and provide endless strategic possibilities for players.
