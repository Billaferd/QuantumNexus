#  Quantum Nexus: Terrain Card Design Mini-Guide

## 1. Conceptualize Your Terrain

*   **Theme:** Define the Terrain card's role. Is it a desolate wasteland, a technologically advanced city, or a place of ancient magic? Who would benefit from this Terrain?
*   **Domain Affinity:** Which domains (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity) does this Terrain favor, hinder, or remain neutral to?  This connection will shape the Terrain's effects and flavor.
*   **Visuals:** Craft a mental image. Is it a sprawling forest, a towering metal structure, a swirling vortex of energy, or a sacred ground marked by divine symbols? Consider the Terrain's domain affinity and thematic elements.

## 2. Determine Domain Points and Rarity

*   **Domain Points (DP):**  Allocate DP to represent the Terrain's connection to the domains. 1 DP is basic, 2 DP is intermediate, 3 DP is advanced, and 4 DP signifies mastery. Each domain can have a maximum of 4 DP allocated to it. Remember, if a domain is mentioned in the Terrain's name, subtype, flavor text, or abilities, it must have at least 1 DP in that domain. The total DP cannot exceed 6.
*   **Rarity:**  Set the Terrain's rarity: Unique, Limited, or Common. Rarity affects the card count, which then influences the bonus AP the card receives. Rarer cards have lower counts and get bigger AP bonuses.

## 3. Establish Card Feel

*   **Impact:** Will the Terrain's presence be primarily constructive, destructive, or neutral? This considers the overall impact of the Terrain card's effects on the game.
*   **Translate Impact into Design:**  A constructive Terrain might enhance unit stats or grant beneficial abilities, while a destructive Terrain could impose penalties or hazardous conditions.

## 4. Calculate Card Costs

*   **Base CP:** Multiply the Terrain's total DP by 2 to get its Base CP cost.
*   **Rarity Bonus AP:** Use the formula: Bonus AP = 0.8 \* (1 / Card Count) to calculate the bonus AP based on the Terrain's rarity.
*   **Total AP:** Add the Base CP and (Base CP \* Rarity Bonus AP) to get the Total AP available for designing the Terrain's abilities. Remember, the total AP cost of all abilities cannot exceed this Total AP pool.

## 5. Design Abilities

*   **Concept and Theme:**  Align the Terrain's abilities with its theme, domain affinity, and card feel.  A Technology-focused Terrain, for example, might enhance Technology units or disrupt enemy Assets.
*   **Types:** Terrain cards primarily have **passive** abilities that are always active, providing ongoing benefits or drawbacks. **Active** abilities that players can trigger are generally not suitable for Terrain cards. While the sources don't explicitly mention **Interrupts** for Terrain cards, you could consider them if they fit the theme and add strategic depth.
*   **Costing:**  Use the Ability Cost Reference Table to determine the AP cost of each ability, ensuring the total doesn't exceed the Terrain's Total AP pool.

## 6. Integrate Keywords (Optional)

*   **Type:**  Select keywords that either reinforce the Terrain's strengths, mitigate its weaknesses, or introduce unique mechanics. Positive keywords add to the AP pool, negative keywords subtract from it, and neutral keywords always add to the pool.
*   **Costing:** Refer to the Keyword Cost Reference Table to find the AP cost of each keyword.

## 7. Craft Flavor Attributes

*   **Name:** Choose a name that is both memorable and evocative, accurately reflecting the Terrain's theme and impact on the game.
*   **Image:**  Provide a vivid description that captures the Terrain's visual identity, incorporating elements relevant to its domain affinity, such as technological structures, mystical landscapes, psionic energies, or divine symbols.
*   **Flavor Text:** Craft a concise and impactful quote or description that offers a glimpse into the Terrain's history, significance, or the events that transpired there.

## 8. Playtest and Iterate

*   **Playtesting:** Thoroughly test your Terrain card in a variety of matchups and deck types to observe its performance. Look for any strengths, weaknesses, or unforeseen interactions with other cards.
*   **Iteration:** Be prepared to modify the Terrain's abilities, keywords, AP cost, or even the core concept based on playtesting feedback.  The goal is to achieve optimal balance and strategic depth.

**Example:  Designing a "Desolate Wasteland" Terrain Card:**

1.  **Concept:** A harsh, irradiated wasteland, punishing to most units but offering a haven for mutated or technologically adapted creatures.

2.  **Domain Affinity:**  Hinders Divinity and Magic (units from these domains suffer penalties). Favors Technology and Psionics (units from these domains might gain benefits).

3.  **Card Feel:**  Destructive (imposes harsh conditions and penalties).

4.  **Domain Points:** Technology (2), Psionics (1) - Total DP: 3

5.  **Rarity:** Limited (2 copies allowed per deck).

6.  **Base CP:** 3 DP \* 2 = 6 CP

7.  **Rarity Bonus AP:**  (1/2) \* 0.8 = 0.4

8.  **Total AP:** 6 + (6 \* 0.4) = 8.4

9.  **Abilities:**

    *   **Passive Ability (3 AP):**  Units with the Divinity or Magic domain have -1 Attack while in this Quadrant.
    *   **Passive Ability (4 AP):** Units with the Technology domain gain +1 Defense while in this Quadrant.

10. **Keywords:** None.

11. **Name:**  Radioactive Ruins

12. **Image:**  Twisted metal skeletons of buildings rise from a cracked, ash-covered ground. Strange, glowing flora sprout in patches, and the air shimmers with a faint, heat-like distortion.

13. **Flavor Text:** "The echoes of a forgotten war linger, twisting life into new, unsettling forms."

**Design Considerations:**

*   This Terrain card creates a strategic choice for players. Do they use units that benefit from the Terrain, or do they avoid it entirely?
*   The card encourages deck diversity by rewarding players who include Technology units and punishing those who heavily rely on Divinity or Magic.
*   The flavor attributes (name, image, flavor text) reinforce the Terrain's harsh, irradiated nature.

Remember to playtest this example Terrain card and make adjustments based on its performance and feedback. The goal is to create Terrain cards that enrich the Quantum Nexus experience, adding layers of strategy and immersing players in its dynamic universe.
