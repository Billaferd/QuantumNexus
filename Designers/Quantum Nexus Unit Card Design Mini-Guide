# Quantum Nexus Leader Unit Design Mini-Guide

## Leader Unit Creation Mini-Guide

This mini-guide walks you through creating a Leader unit card for Quantum Nexus. It incorporates the best practices and addresses the areas for improvement identified in the critique of the non-leader Unit Design Mini-Guide.

### 1. Start with a Concept ()

*   **Theme:** Begin with a clear idea of the Leader unit's role and purpose. What makes this Leader unique and compelling? What kind of player would include this Leader in their deck? ()
*   **Domain:** Which of the four domains (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity) is central to this Leader's identity? The domain will significantly influence the Leader's abilities, stats, and overall feel. () 
*   **Visuals:** Envision the Leader's appearance. A captivating visual design is essential for a Leader unit. What striking details will capture the Leader's essence and make it stand out on the battlefield? ()

### 2. Determine Domain Points, Rarity, and Leadership Factor ()

*   **Domain Points (DP):**  Allocate DP based on the Leader's mastery of its domain(s). Remember that 1 DP signifies basic usage, 2 DP indicates intermediate mastery, 3 DP represents advanced command, and 4 DP signifies complete mastery of the domain.  Each domain can have a maximum of 4 DP allocated to it. If a domain is mentioned in the Leader's name, subtype, flavor text, or abilities, the card must have at least 1 DP in that domain. ()

*   **Rarity:** Decide on the Leader's rarity (Unique, Limited, Common). Rarity influences the card count, which dictates how many copies of the Leader card can be included in a player's deck. Rarer cards have lower counts, making them more valuable and sought-after. Rarity also impacts the bonus Ability Points (AP) the card receives during the calculation process. ()

*   **Leadership Factor:**  Since we are creating a Leader unit, the Leadership Factor is always **1**. This factor will be used later in the AP calculation. ()

### 3. Define Card Feel and Translate it to Mechanics ()

*   **Malevolence:** Is the Leader benevolent, malevolent, or neutral?  ()
*   **Utility:** Does the Leader prioritize utility, disruption, or maintain a balance between the two?  ()
*   **Combat:** Is the Leader designed for offense, defense, or a balanced approach? ()
*   **Impact:**  Will the Leader's presence on the battlefield be primarily constructive, destructive, or neutral? ()

Carefully consider how each of these card feel axes will manifest through the Leader's mechanics. Here's how you can translate card feel into the Leader's design:

*   **Abilities:** The Leader's abilities should reflect its card feel. For instance, a benevolent leader might have abilities focused on healing allies or strengthening their defenses.  A disruptive Leader, on the other hand, could have abilities that interrupt an opponent's actions or force them to discard cards.  ()

*   **Stats:**  The Leader's Attack and Defense stats should also align with its card feel. An offensive Leader will likely have a higher Attack stat, while a defensive Leader will have a more robust Defense stat. ()

*   **Keywords:** Keywords can further emphasize the Leader's card feel. A Leader with "Provoke," for example, reinforces its defensive nature by compelling enemies to attack it. A Leader with "Flying" could be more aligned with a utility or offensive role, allowing it to move freely around the battlefield or avoid ground-based threats. ()

### 4. Calculate Card Costs ()

*   **Base CP:** The Base CP is determined by the Leader's total DP. Multiply the total DP by 2.  ()
*   **Stat Points:**  Each point of Attack and Defense costs 0.5 CP.  Calculate the total stat point cost by adding the Leader's Attack and Defense together, then dividing the sum by 2. ()
*   **Adjusted CP:**  To determine the Adjusted CP, subtract half of the total stat point cost from the Base CP. ()

*   **Rarity Bonus AP:** Calculate the bonus AP that the Leader receives based on its rarity using the formula: Bonus AP = 0.8 \* (1 / Card Count). ()  

*   **Total AP:**  The Total AP available for designing the Leader's abilities and keywords is calculated using the following formula: 

Adjusted CP + (Adjusted CP \* Rarity Bonus AP) + (Adjusted CP \* 0.5 \* Leadership Factor) ()

Remember that the total AP spent on the Leader's abilities and keywords cannot go over this Total AP pool. ()

### 5. Design Abilities ()

*   **Concept and Theme:**  The Leader's abilities, whether active, passive, or interrupts, must align with the theme and domain you've established for the Leader. A Technology Leader, for example, might have abilities that enhance other Technology units or disrupt an opponent's technological infrastructure. ()
*   **Types:**  Leaders can utilize all three types of abilities: ()

    *   **Active Abilities:** These abilities, triggered by the player, often involve a CP cost.  They provide strategic choices and can significantly impact the flow of the game. ()
    *   **Passive Abilities:** Always in effect, passive abilities provide ongoing benefits or drawbacks without the need for activation. ()
    *   **Interrupts:** These abilities trigger automatically in response to specific events, adding a layer of reactive counterplay and strategic depth. ()

*   **Costing:** Determine the AP cost of each ability using the Ability Cost Reference Table. Remember, the total AP cost of all abilities cannot exceed the Leader's total AP pool. () Additionally, if an ability has an activation cost (CP, discarding cards, etc.), factor in the cost when determining its impact on the game.  ()

### 6. Add Keywords (Optional) ()

*   **Type:** Choose keywords that complement the Leader's strengths, mitigate weaknesses, or introduce unique mechanics. Positive keywords add to the AP pool, negative keywords subtract from it, and neutral keywords always add to the pool. This balance is important for ensuring that keywords are appropriately costed. ()
*   **Costing:** Determine the AP cost of each keyword using the Keyword Cost Reference Table. ()

### 7. Determine Rank and Range (If Applicable)  ()

*   **Rank:** All Leader units in Quantum Nexus are **Terrestrial**, meaning they are deployed on the battlefield. () 

*   **Range:** Decide on the Leader's attack range: Close, Mid, or Far.  The choice of range should align with the Leader's tactical role and playstyle. () For example, a Leader designed for close-quarters combat might have a Close or Mid range, while a Leader specializing in ranged attacks might have a Mid or Far range.

### 8. Assign Attack and Defense Stats ()

*   **Balance:** The Leader's Attack and Defense stats should be in harmony with its CP cost, abilities, keywords, and intended role in a deck. A high Attack value generally comes at the cost of a lower Defense value, and vice-versa. ()
*   **Role:** The Leader's combat role—offensive, defensive, or balanced— will influence its stats.  Offensive Leaders will typically have a higher Attack stat, while defensive Leaders will boast a more substantial Defense stat. ()

### 9. Craft Flavor Attributes ()

*   **Name:** Choose a name that is not only memorable and evocative but also captures the essence of the Leader's theme and personality. ()
*   **Image:**  The image is crucial for establishing the Leader's visual identity. Create a detailed description that captures the Leader's theme, mood, and presence on the battlefield. ()
*   **Flavor Text:**  Flavor text adds depth and personality to the Leader. Use a concise and impactful quote or description that offers insights into the Leader's backstory, abilities, or significance within the Quantum Nexus universe. ()

### 10.  Playtest and Iterate ()

*   **Playtesting:** Rigorous playtesting is essential to refine your Leader unit. Test your Leader card against diverse opponents and decks to observe how it performs in actual gameplay scenarios. () 
*   **Iteration:** Be receptive to feedback from playtesting and adjust your Leader's stats, abilities, keywords, CP cost, or even the core concept based on the insights you gain. ()  Iteration is key to achieving a balanced and engaging Leader unit card.

**Important Considerations for Leader Unit Design:**

*   **Unique Identity:**  Leader units should stand out from non-leader units. Their abilities should be impactful, their presence on the battlefield should be noticeable, and their design should convey a sense of leadership and power.

*   **CP Cost Reduction:**  Leaders receive a 50% reduction in their CP cost due to their unique role in a deck.  This means you can design more potent abilities or assign higher stats, but it also necessitates careful balancing to avoid creating overly dominant Leaders.

*   **Synergy with Deck Archetypes:** Consider how the Leader might synergize with specific deck archetypes. Design abilities that encourage players to build decks around the Leader's strengths and strategic focus.

**Final Thoughts:**

Creating a compelling Leader unit card in Quantum Nexus requires a blend of creativity, strategic thinking, and careful attention to the design guidelines. Embrace the iterative process, experiment with different concepts and mechanics, and strive to create Leaders that will captivate players and leave a lasting mark on the game's universe.
