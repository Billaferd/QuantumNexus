# Quantum Nexus: Unit Design Mini-Guide

## Designing Unit Cards in Quantum Nexus

This mini-guide will walk you through the process of creating a non-leader unit card for Quantum Nexus, using the best practices outlined in the sources.

### 1. Start with a Concept

*   **Theme:** Begin with a clear idea of the unit's role and purpose in the game. What makes it unique? What kind of player would use it?
*   **Domain:** Which of the four domains (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity) does the unit belong to? This will influence its abilities, stats, and overall feel.
*   **Visuals:** Imagine the unit's appearance. What does it look like? This will help with the image description later.

### 2. Determine Domain Points and Rarity

*   **Domain Points (DP):** Assign DP based on the unit's mastery of its domain(s). 1 DP signifies basic usage, 2 DP is intermediate, 3 DP is advanced, and 4 DP represents mastery. Each domain can have a maximum of 4 DP, and a card must have at least 1 DP in a domain if it's mentioned in the card's attributes.
*   **Rarity:** The card's rarity (Unique, Limited, Common) affects its card count and the bonus AP it receives. Rarer cards have lower counts and higher bonuses.

### 3. Define Card Feel

*   **Malevolence:** Is the unit benevolent, malevolent, or neutral?
*   **Utility:** Is it utility-focused, disruptive, or a balance?
*   **Combat:** Is it offensive, defensive, or balanced?
*   **Impact:** Is it constructive, destructive, or neutral?

These choices will influence the unit's abilities and stats. For example, a benevolent, utility-focused unit might have abilities that heal allies or draw cards. A malevolent, offensive unit might have high Attack and abilities that deal direct damage.

### 4. Calculate Card Costs

*   **Base CP:** Multiply the total DP by 2. This is the starting CP cost for the card.
*   **Rarity Bonus AP:** Calculate the bonus AP based on the card count using the formula: Bonus AP = 0.8 \* (1 / Card Count).
*   **Total AP:** Add the Base CP and the Rarity Bonus AP. This is the total AP pool you have to spend on abilities and keywords.

### 5. Design Abilities

*   **Concept and Theme:** Abilities should align with the unit's theme and domain. For example, a Technology unit might have abilities that buff other Tech units or disable enemy Assets.
*   **Types:** Units can have active abilities, passive abilities, and interrupts.
*   **Costing:** Use the Ability Cost Reference Table in the sources to determine the AP cost of each ability. Remember that the total AP cost of all abilities cannot exceed the unit's AP pool.

### 6. Add Keywords (Optional)

*   **Type:** Choose keywords that enhance the unit's strengths or mitigate its weaknesses.
*   **Costing:** Use the Keyword Cost Reference Table to determine the AP cost of each keyword.

### 7. Determine Rank and Range

*   **Rank:** Is the unit Terrestrial, Aerial, Orbital, or Interstellar? This determines where it can be deployed on the battlefield.
*   **Range:** If the unit is Terrestrial or Aerial, what is its attack range (Close, Mid, or Far)?
*   Orbital and Interstellar units only have a Defense stat and no range.

### 8. Assign Attack and Defense Stats

*   **Balance:** Stats should be balanced with the unit's CP cost, abilities, and keywords.
*   **Role:** A unit's role (offensive, defensive, balanced) will influence its stats.
*   **Rank:** Terrestrial and Aerial units have both Attack and Defense. Orbital and Interstellar units only have Defense.

### 9. Craft Flavor Attributes

*   **Name:** Choose a name that is evocative, memorable, and reflects the unit's theme.
*   **Image:** Create a detailed description of the card's artwork.
*   **Flavor Text:** Write a short quote or description that adds personality and lore.

### 10. Playtest and Iterate

*   Playtesting is crucial! Test your card against a variety of opponents and decks to see how it performs.
*   Based on playtesting feedback, adjust the unit's stats, abilities, keywords, or even its concept to achieve balance and strategic depth.

**Remember:** This guide provides a framework. The creative possibilities for designing non-leader unit cards in Quantum Nexus are vast! Don't be afraid to experiment, break conventions, and create cards that are unique, engaging, and contribute to the rich tapestry of the game's universe.
