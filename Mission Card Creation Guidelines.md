# Mission Card Creation Guidelines

## Domain Points

Each mission card is associated with one or more domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. These domains can have a maximum of four points each. A total of 0 points in a domain indicates no skill in that domain, while 4 points represent complete mastery.

## Point Distribution

Mission cards must allocate between 1 and 6 points across the domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. It's important to note that no domain should exceed a maximum of four points on a single mission card. The total domain points on a card can range from 1 to 6, but individual domains should not exceed 4 points.

## CP Value

Every mission card has a CP (Command Points) value. The CP values of all selected mission cards are added together to determine the player's starting CP pool.

## CP Distribution

CP should be distributed such that 6 domain points translate to approximately 20 CP, with a margin of around +-3.

## Difficulty Scaling and Thematic Elements

Each mission card should not only present a challenge but also immerse players in the thematic elements associated with the chosen domains. Here are some clarifications and examples:

  - Technology: If you allocate domain points to Technology, consider challenges that involve advanced gadgets, inventions, or strategic maneuvers. The thematic elements should revolve around technological advancements and innovation.
    - Example Challenge for 3 Technology Points: "Deploy three technology-based units that synergize to create a powerful combo."
  - Magic: For Magic domain points, challenges should tap into mystical and arcane themes. Think of challenges that require spellcasting, enchantments, or harnessing magical energies.
    - Example Challenge for 4 Magic Points: "Conjure a magical barrier that protects your units from all attacks for one turn."
  - Psionics: Psionics should evoke psychic and mental abilities. Challenges can involve manipulating thoughts, foreseeing events, or exerting mental control.
    - Example Challenge for 5 Psionics Points: "Dominate your opponent's mind, forcing them to discard their entire hand."
  - Divinity: Divinity should encompass divine and spiritual themes. Challenges may involve divine blessings, celestial interventions, or acts of faith.
    - Example Challenge for 2 Theism Points: "Receive a divine blessing that doubles the strength of one of your units for a turn."

## Passive Ability

Each mission card comes with a passive ability that activates upon mission completion. This ability triggers at the start of each subsequent turn. The power of this ability scales with the difficulty of the mission and the total domain points on the card.

Single-Use Ability

## In addition to the passive ability, each mission card provides a single-use ability that automatically triggers when the mission is completed. This ability's strength also scales based on the mission's difficulty and domain points.

## Challenges

Every mission card must present a specific challenge that the player must complete. The complexity of the challenge is determined by the total number of domain points used on the card, with higher points leading to more difficult challenges. These challenges may involve multiple steps and items to complete.

## Difficulty

Domain point should be an easy challenge. 2 points would be an intermediate challenge. 3-4 points should be an advanced challenge. 5-6 points should be extremely challenging. The points come from the sum of all of the domain points in use on the card. If a card has 1 point in Technology and 2 points in Psionics, that would be 3 points for the challenge in total.

## Example Challenges

- 1 point - play three cards of a specific type in a single turn.
- 2 points - defeat two opponent units with a single attack.
- 3 points - remove an entire (front or back) row of at least five units.
- 4 Points - Return to play ten cards from the discard pile.
- 5 points - Remove at least ten cards to empty the opponent's side of the board in a single turn.
- 6 points - Defend against 5 attacks without a single card going to the discard pile in a single turn.
