# Quantum Nexus Mission Card Creation Guidelines

## I. Introduction

Quantum Nexus is a strategic trading card game (TCG) that immerses players in a captivating sci-fi universe filled with advanced technology, mystical magic, potent psionics, and divine intervention. To contribute to this dynamic world, card creators must adhere to a set of core design principles and understand the fundamental building blocks of card creation.

### A. Core Design Principles

 * Card Control: Each player retains complete ownership and control of their cards throughout the game. Players are not allowed to touch any other players cards and a players cards are not allowed to leave that players play area.
 * Predictable Gameplay: The only random element in Quantum Nexus is the initial card shuffle. This design choice eliminates luck-based mechanics like dice rolls, coin flips, or random card draws, ensuring that strategic decision-making and tactical planning are the primary factors that determine the outcome of battles.
 * Streamlined Combat: Units in Quantum Nexus do not have health points. Instead, their resilience is represented by a Defense value. When a unit is attacked, its Defense is compared directly to the attacker's Attack value. If the Attack exceeds the Defense, the defending unit is discarded. This streamlined system simplifies combat, reduces bookkeeping, and accelerates gameplay.

## II. Battlefield and Tactical Maneuvers

Understanding the battlefield and the mechanics of card range is crucial for effective card design.

 * A. Battlefield Structure: The Quantum Nexus battlefield consists of two separate 3x2 grids, one for each player. Each grid has six distinct quadrants where units can be deployed. The two front rows of opposing grids are considered adjacent for targeting purposes, but units never physically enter the opponent's play area.
 * B. Range Types: Each terrestrial and aerial unit card has a defined range that dictates which quadrants it can attack or affect with its abilities:
   * Close Range: Units can only target adjacent quadrants on their own side of the battlefield.
   * Mid Range: Units can target adjacent and diagonal quadrants on their own side, as well as any quadrant in the opponent's front row.
   * Far Range: Units can only target quadrants that are 2 rows away from its current position. If a unit is in the back row, it can only attack the enemies front row, if the unit is in the front row, it can attack the enemies back row. This range system adds a layer of tactical depth to the game, forcing players to carefully consider unit placement and movement to maximize their offensive and defensive capabilities.
 * C. Movement: Every terrestrial and aerial unit may choose to attack or move during the Combat Phase, it can move to any adjacent quadrant, but not diagonally.
 * D. Card Ranks: Each Unit, Leader, and Asset card has one of 4 ranks. Terrestrial and aerial are assigned to Units and Leaders. Orbital, and interstellar are assigned to Assets. Terrestrial and aerial units are deployed to the battle field. Orbital and Interstellar units are deployed to the Load out. Events and Upgrades do not have a rank.
 * E. Turn Sequence: Each turn has four phases: Ready, Deployment, Command, and Battle.
  1. The Ready Phase sets the stage for your turn. CP resets, players draw cards, units deactivate.
  2. During the Deployment Phase, players play their units, upgrades, and other permanent cards from their hand.
  3. In the Command Phase, you activate abilities or deploy Events.
  4. The Battle Phase is where you declare attacks against opponent units.
  5. The players alternate turns during each phase. The phase ends when both players pass.
  6. The player who spent the least amount of CP in the previous phase goes first in the next phase.

## III. Card Types and Subtypes

Quantum Nexus features a diverse range of card types, each playing a unique role in shaping your strategies:

 * A. Card Types:
   * Units: The heart of your army, these cards represent characters or creatures that battle on the battlefield. Units possess Attack and Defense values, as well as a defined range (close, mid, or far). Units are deployed to the Battlefield, and must be either Terrestrial or Aerial rank.
     a. Leaders: These are special, powerful units with enhanced abilities and a significant impact on the battlefield. Due to their strength, only one Leader can be present in a single quadrant at a time.
   * Upgrades: These cards modify other cards (usually units), boosting their stats or granting them additional abilities. Upgrades can be played on units in the battlefield or on other cards in your loadout, depending on their specific effects. Upgrades must declare the type that they augment.
   * Assets: These cards provide ongoing benefits or strategic advantages. They reside in your loadout and are not directly involved in combat, but their effects can significantly influence the course of the game. Assets are either Orbital or Interstellar rank.
   * Events: These powerful cards trigger immediate effects, such as manipulating the battlefield, or drawing additional cards. Events are played during the Command Phase and are discarded afterward. They do not have Passive abilities, but can have both Active Abilities (With no CP Activation Cost, but can have other activation costs) and Interrupts.
   * Terrain: These cards alter the battlefield itself, granting bonuses to specific units or imposing restrictions on enemy movement or abilities. Terrain cards are played on specific quadrants and remain in play until removed.
 * B. Subtypes: In addition to their main type, all cards have a subtype. Subtypes add further specificity to a card's identity and often interact with card abilities or effects. Examples of subtypes include "Mech," "Squad," and "Specialist."

## IV. Domain System

In Quantum Nexus, each card is intrinsically linked to one or more of four key domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. These domains represent the fundamental forces and energies that shape the game's universe, and they play a crucial role in defining the abilities and capabilities of each card. 

### Domain Characteristics

Each domain possesses unique characteristics that shape the cards associated with it. Domain points drive the theme of the card:
   * Technology: Wields an arsenal of ranged weaponry, devastating area-of-effect attacks, and sophisticated battlefield control systems. Technological prowess enables strategic dominance through calculated strikes and tactical maneuvers. However, close-quarters combat and opponents capable of bypassing or exploiting technological vulnerabilities pose significant challenges.
  * Magic: Offers unparalleled versatility, precise unit targeting, and arcane spellcasting for close-to-mid-range engagements. Magical prowess allows for devastating offensive and defensive spells, empowering wielders to manipulate the battlefield to their advantage. However, overwhelming numbers or adversaries resistant to magical energies may prove difficult to overcome.
  * Psionics: Masters of the mind, employing telekinetic manipulation and potent psychic abilities to dominate close-range encounters. Psionic prowess grants unmatched control over the battlefield, bending both allies and enemies to the wielder's will. However, opponents capable of resisting or nullifying mental influence pose a significant threat.
  * Divinity: Commands divine blessings, holy/unholy powers, and celestial/infernal intervention, impacting the battlefield on a grand scale. Divine prowess allows for miraculous feats, righteous judgment, and otherworldly manifestations. However, the fickle nature of divine forces, potential sacrifices, and specific conditions for wielding such power introduce an element of unpredictability. (Encompasses all deities, celestial, infernal, etc.)

## V. Mission Cards: The Foundation of Your Quantum Nexus Strategy

Mission cards are the cornerstone of your Quantum Nexus deck, shaping your strategic direction and influencing your available resources throughout the game. They serve multiple crucial functions:

### 1. Defining Your Domain Expertise

 * Each mission card is associated with one or more of the four domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity.
 * The points allocated to each domain on your mission cards determine your deck's focus and the types of cards you can include.

### 2. Dictating Your Command Point (CP) Budget

 * Command Points (CP) are the currency you use to play cards and activate abilities.
 * The total CP value of your chosen mission cards determines your starting CP pool for each round.
3. Setting Challenges and Rewards:
 * Each mission card presents a unique challenge that you must strive to complete.
 * Upon successful completion, you gain access to both a one-time ability and a passive ability.
 * These abilities offer powerful effects that can turn the tide of battle in your favor.

#### Domain Points: Your Path to Mastery

 * Allocation: Mission cards distribute points among the four domains. A Mission Card can have a maximum of 4 points per domain. A player must have a total of 6 points across all mission cards.
 * Significance:
   * 0 points in a domain indicate no proficiency.
   * 4 points represent transcendent mastery in that domain.
   * The points you allocate to each domain on your mission cards determine the maximum domain values allowed on other cards in your deck.
   * The number of domain points assigned should vary between 1 and 4. The player will need to create a set of mission cards that total 6 points. A player may use 6, 1 points cards, or 2, 3 point cards, or any other combination to equal 6. The more choice they have, the more interesting the choices are.

##### Example

If your mission cards have a total of 3 points in Technology, you cannot include unit cards with a Technology value exceeding 3. Nor can they use any card with another 4 points. They are limited to any combination of cards that total 1 technology point and 2 points of any combination from any other domain, or they can choose 3 points from any combination of domains except technology.

#### Command Points (CP): Fueling Your Actions

 * Starting CP Pool:  The sum of the CP values of all your mission cards determines your initial CP pool.
 * CP Cost of Cards: Each card has a CP cost indicated in the top left corner.
 * Spending CP: You spend CP to play cards from your hand onto the battlefield or activate card abilities.
 * Strategic Importance: Managing your CP wisely is crucial for making impactful plays and outsmarting your opponent.

### 3. Unlocking Power: Challenges, Abilities, and Rewards

Each mission card features a unique challenge that tests your strategic prowess. Once you complete a mission's challenge, you reap the rewards in the form of powerful abilities:
 * One-Time Ability: A potent effect that triggers immediately upon completing the challenge.
 * Passive Ability: An ongoing effect that activates at the start of each subsequent turn after completing the challenge.

The strength of these abilities scales with the difficulty of the challenge, which is determined by the total domain points on the mission card.

## VI. Challenges: Proving Your Mastery in Quantum Nexus

In Quantum Nexus, challenges are the heart of every mission card, testing your strategic acumen and rewarding your success with powerful abilities. These challenges vary in difficulty, requiring you to demonstrate your mastery of the chosen domains and your ability to adapt to the ever-changing battlefield.

### Challenge Design: Variety and Depth

Ensuring that challenges are fair and balanced within a mission cards context is important and should follow these steps.

**1. Use the Difficulty Scale**

*   **Level 1 (1-3 CP):** Straightforward actions achievable within a turn, like deploying a specific unit type or activating a basic ability (inspired by ). 
*   **Level 2 (4-6 CP):**  Slightly more involved, potentially requiring specific card combinations, achieving a short-term goal (e.g., controlling a quadrant for a turn), or brief resource management.
*   **Level 3 (7-9 CP):**  More intricate objectives, demanding specific card synergies, achieving a more challenging combat goal, or sustained board control over multiple turns. 
*   **Level 4 (10-12 CP):** Difficult goals that might span multiple turns, necessitate complex synergies, or impose minor drawbacks on the player pursuing them.
*   **Level 5 (13+ CP):**  The most challenging, potentially game-changing objectives requiring long-term planning, significant synergies, or substantial drawbacks as trade-offs for powerful rewards.

Designers should assign a difficulty level to each new challenge based on this scale.

**2. Apply a Domain Point Modifier**

To account for the impact of domain alignment on challenge difficulty, implement a modifier based on the mission card's DP distribution:

*   **+1 CP Modifier:** Challenges directly aligned with a domain where the mission card has 4 DP.
*   **0 CP Modifier:** Challenges aligned with a domain where the mission card has 2-3 DP. 
*   **-1 CP Modifier:** Challenges aligned with a domain where the mission card has 1 DP.

This modifier acknowledges that challenges tied to higher DP domains are inherently more potent due to the power level associated with those domains on the mission card.

**3. Calculate Preliminary Challenge CP**

Based on the difficulty level and domain modifier, calculate the Preliminary Challenge CP:

```
Preliminary Challenge CP = Difficulty Level + Domain Point Modifier 
```

**4.  Consider Ability Strength and Adjust**

The Preliminary Challenge CP serves as a starting point.  Designers would then evaluate the strength of the mission card's passive and one-time abilities in conjunction with the challenge's Preliminary CP cost. This step involves subjective judgment and playtesting:

*   **Powerful Abilities:** If the mission card grants very strong abilities, the Preliminary Challenge CP might be reduced by 1-2 CP to compensate, ensuring the mission card's overall power level remains balanced. 
*   **Weaker Abilities:** If the abilities are less impactful, the Preliminary Challenge CP could be left as is or potentially increased by 1 CP to reflect the easier path to achieving those benefits.

This step ensures alignment with the principle of balancing challenge difficulty with ability strength.

**5. Determine Final Challenge CP**

After considering ability strength, the Preliminary Challenge CP is finalized. This Final Challenge CP is then used in the Adjusted CP formula: `AdjustedCP = BaseCP + (ChallengeCP - AbilityCP)`.

**Example Application**

Let's say we're designing a mission card with 3 DP in Technology and 1 DP in Divinity. The challenge involves deploying a Technology unit with a specific keyword and then using that unit to destroy an opponent's unit.

1.  **Difficulty Level:** This challenge seems moderately difficult, potentially a Level 3 (3-4 CP).
2.  **Domain Point Modifier:** The challenge is primarily aligned with Technology (3 DP), so it receives a 0 CP modifier.
3.  **Preliminary Challenge CP:** 3 (Difficulty Level) + 0 (Domain Modifier) = 3 CP
4.  **Ability Strength and Adjustment:**  Let's assume the mission card's abilities are relatively powerful. To compensate, the Preliminary Challenge CP is reduced by 1 CP.
5.  **Final Challenge CP:** 3 CP - 1 CP = 2 CP

This 2 CP value would then be used in the Adjusted CP calculation for the mission card.

#### Example Challenges

To give you a taste of the challenges that await, here are a few examples from different domains

 * Generic (1 point): Play three cards of a specific type (e.g., Unit, Event) in a single turn.
 * Technology (2 points): Activate a tech device that temporarily disables all of your opponent's assets for one turn.
 * Magic (3 points): Channel elemental forces to cast a spell that removes all enemy units in a chosen row from the battlefield.
 * Psionics (4 points): Create a psychic barrier that renders your units immune to all forms of attack for one turn.
 * Divinity (2 points): Receive a divine blessing that doubles the strength of one of your units for a turn.

These are just a few examples, and the possibilities for challenge design are vast. As you explore Quantum Nexus, you'll encounter a wide range of challenges that will test your strategic skills and reward your ingenuity.

### Rewards for Success: Passive and One-Time Abilities

Completing a mission's challenge is not just about overcoming obstacles; it unlocks potent abilities that can significantly impact the game. These abilities are your reward for strategic mastery and come in two forms:

 * Passive Abilities: These abilities trigger at the start of each of your turns after completing the challenge, providing ongoing benefits like gaining extra CP, reducing ability costs, or enhancing your units.
 * One-Time Abilities: These abilities activate immediately upon completing the challenge, offering a one-time boost, such as drawing additional cards, disabling an opponent's card, or dealing direct damage.

The strength of both passive and one-time abilities scales with the difficulty of the challenge and the total domain points on the mission card.

The stronger these abilities are the fewer CP will be available on the card, but under powered abilities will lead to more CP available.

## VII. Passive and One-Time Abilities: Reaping the Rewards of Your Missions

In Quantum Nexus, your rewards for completing a mission's challenge are potent abilities that can swing the momentum of the game in your favor. These abilities come in two flavors: passive and one-time, each serving a distinct purpose in enhancing your strategic arsenal. 

These abilities come in two flavors: passive and one-time, each serving a distinct purpose in enhancing your strategic arsenal.

### Passive Abilities: Your Continuous Advantage

Once you conquer a mission's challenge, its passive ability awakens, granting you an ongoing advantage that persists throughout the game. These abilities are automatic and require no additional CP to activate. They are a testament to your mastery of the chosen domains, subtly influencing the battlefield in your favor with each passing turn.

Examples of Passive Abilities

 * Resource Generation: Gain additional Command Points (CP) at the start of each turn, allowing you to deploy more powerful cards or activate more abilities.
 * Cost Reduction: Decrease the CP cost of specific actions, such as deploying units or activating certain abilities.
 * Card Advantage: Draw extra cards during your turn, giving you more options and flexibility in your strategy.
 * Unit Enhancement: Buff the Attack or Defense of your units, making them more formidable in combat.
 * Special Effects: Trigger unique effects, such as discarding cards from your opponent's hand, manipulating the battlefield, or granting special abilities to your units.

The power of passive abilities scales with the difficulty of the mission's challenge and the total domain points on the card. Higher-level missions unlock more potent passive abilities that can dramatically alter the course of the game.

### One-Time Abilities: A Moment of Impact

Unlike passive abilities, one-time abilities unleash their power in a single, decisive moment—immediately upon completing a mission's challenge. These abilities are designed to create an immediate impact on the battlefield, offering a tactical advantage or disrupting your opponent's strategy.

Examples of One-Time Abilities:

 * Direct Damage: Inflict damage on an opponent's unit or asset, potentially removing it from play.
 * Card Disruption: Force your opponent to discard cards from their hand or deck, hindering their options.
 * Battlefield Manipulation: Alter the terrain or rearrange units on the battlefield to your advantage.
 * Resource Boost: Gain a temporary influx of CP or other resources, allowing for a powerful combo play.
 * Special Effects: Trigger unique effects that can turn the tide of battle, such as reviving a discarded unit, gaining temporary invincibility, or summoning a powerful ally.

The impact of one-time abilities also scales with the challenge difficulty and domain points, ensuring that the reward matches the effort invested in completing the mission.

### Strategic Considerations

When creating mission cards, it's crucial to consider both the passive and one-time abilities they offer. Here are some key strategic factors to keep in mind

 * Synergy with other cards: Create mission cards whose abilities complement your overall strategy and the cards in your deck.
 * Timing: Consider when you want the abilities to trigger. Do you need an immediate boost from a one-time ability, or would a long-term advantage from a passive ability be more beneficial?
 * Versatility: Some abilities are more versatile than others, offering broader utility in different situations.
 * Risk vs. Reward: Higher-difficulty challenges yield more powerful abilities, but they also carry greater risk. Assess the potential reward against the difficulty of achieving it.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can create mission cards that empower a players deck and give them the edge they need to claim victory in Quantum Nexus.

## VI. Challenges in Quantum Nexus: Detailed Examples and Design Considerations

By carefully designing one-time abilities that are impactful, strategic, and unique, you can create mission cards that offer rewarding and memorable moments for Quantum Nexus players.

## X. Mission Card Calculations

Mission cards have several calculations to create some balance. The mission cards create the basis for the amount of CP that a player has during their turn. This CP value is determined by several interconnected formulas. The fomelas are designed to balance the Abilities, Challenges, and CP. You should be adventurous to see what combinations can be achieved.

### Mission Card Creation Formulas

1. **Assign Total Domain Points**:
    * Each mission card can have a maximum of **4 points** assigned to a single domain.
    * Each mission card must have a minimum of **1 point** and a maximum of **4 points** assigned across all domains. 
    * Players must create a set of mission cards that total **6 points** across all domains.

2. **Calculate Base CP**:
    *  Multiply the total Domain Points (DP) assigned to the mission card by 3: `BaseCP = Domain Points (DP) * 3`

3. **Create Abilities**:
    * Design one passive and one active ability for the mission card.
    * Choose abilities with CP values that, when combined, are approximately double the card's Base CP. 
    * For example, if a mission card has a Base CP of 6, the combined value of its passive and active abilities should be around 12.

4. **Create the Mission Challenge**:
    * Select one or more challenges from the challenge table in the sources, 

5. **Adjust CP Levels**:
    * Determine if the combined CP value of the abilities (AbilityCP) and challenges (ChallengeCP) is higher or lower than the Base CP.
    * Calculate the difference between the ChallengeCP and AbilityCP.
    * Add this difference to the Base CP to determine the final Adjusted CP of the mission card: `AdjustedCP = BaseCP + (ChallengeCP - AbilityCP)`

6. **Minimum Adjusted CP:**
The Adjusted CP of a mission card cannot be less than 0. If the Adjusted CP calculation results in a value less than 0, the mission card's Adjusted CP is set to 0.

these calculations are here to ensure that the mission cards are developed in a way that is fair and balanced. the calculations strive to ensure that a balance is struck between all parts of the mission card.

## X. Putting it All Together: Creating a Quantum Nexus Mission Card

 * Domain Focus: The card emphasizes the Divinity domain, requiring a significant presence of Divinity units to complete the challenge.
 * Challenge Difficulty: The challenge is moderately difficult, requiring the player to have deployed five Divinity units, which demands a focused strategy and resource management.
 * Thematic Abilities: Both the one-time and passive abilities align with the Divinity theme, focusing on divine intervention, resurrection, and the accumulation of divine power.
 * Balanced Rewards: The abilities are powerful but not overwhelming, providing a significant advantage without making the game unbalanced.
 * Clear Presentation: The card follows the established template, presenting information concisely and clearly. The image and flavor text enhance the card's thematic appeal.

By following these guidelines and drawing inspiration from this example, you can create compelling mission cards that add depth and excitement to your Quantum Nexus games. Remember to consider the following key points

 * Align the challenge, one-time ability, and passive ability with the chosen domain(s).
 * Ensure the challenge's difficulty is balanced with the rewards offered.
 * Create abilities that are thematically relevant, impactful, and fun to use.
 * Present the card clearly and concisely using the established template.
 * Don't be afraid to mix and match different abilities and challenges to create hybrids.
 * The challenges, abilities, and CP are all linked in the formula, try using higher priced challenges and lower priced abilities to have higher CP. You can also use higher priced abilities and lower priced challenges for less CP. Be creative with the balance.
   * For example if there is 4 CP, try combining 2 Challenges that are 2 CP each.

With creativity and careful design, you can craft mission cards that will elevate your Quantum Nexus experience and inspire countless strategic possibilities.
