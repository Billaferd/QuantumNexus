# Mission Card Creation Guidelines

## Introduction

Quantum Nexus is a trading card game that adheres to the following tenants of design.

1. Cards will never cross the table to an opponent's side. Every player will always be in full possession of their cards. Effects may allow other players to control a card, but that cars will always stay within the area of the owners control.

2. No randomness, ever. There will never be any randomness except for the card shuffle. There will never be dice rolls or coin flips. The only exception is when the first player is selected through card flips at the start. See below.

3. There are no health points, defense is not a measure of health, and players should not have to bookkeep health on their units. A unit is defeated when damage exceeds defense.

## Domain Points

- Each mission card is associated with one or more domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity.
- These domains can have a maximum of four points each.
- A total of 0 points in a domain indicates no skill, while 4 points represent transcendent mastery.

## Point Distribution

- Mission cards must allocate between 1 and 6 points across the domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity.
- No individual domain should exceed a maximum of 4 points on a single mission card.
- The total domain points on a card can range from 1 to 6, but individual domains must range between 0 and 4 points.

## CP Value

Every mission card has a CP (Command Points) value. The CP values of all selected mission cards are added together to determine the player's starting CP pool.

## CP Value Distribution for Mission Cards

1. **Total Starting CP Pool**: Each player's starting CP pool is determined by adding the CP values of all the mission cards in their deck. This total pool represents the resources available to the player throughout the game.

2. **Domain Points to CP Conversion**: To determine how many CP each domain point contributes to a mission card, follow these guidelines:
   - Each domain point allocated to a mission card contributes between 3 to 5 CP to its CP cost. The card designer decides the exact CP contribution for each domain point but must fall within this range.
   - The total CP cost of a mission card is calculated by summing the CP contributions from all its allocated domain points.

3. **Individual Domain Limit**: No single domain point on a mission card can contribute more than 4 CP to the card's total CP cost. This ensures the CP distribution remains balanced and prevents excessive CP generation from a single domain.

4. **Minimum and Maximum CP**: A mission card's CP cost must fall within 1 to 10 CP. This range maintains balance and prevents mission cards from being overpowered or weak.

5. **Challenging CP Allocations**: To create challenging mission cards, consider allocating domain points so that the CP cost is proportional to the challenge's difficulty. Higher-difficulty challenges should generally have higher CP costs, reflecting the complexity and significance of the task.

6. **Scaling CP for Thematic Elements**: While designing mission cards, consider the thematic elements associated with the chosen domains. Ensure that the CP distribution aligns with the thematic challenge presented by the mission. For example, a mission with strong magical elements might have a higher CP cost if it offers significant magical advantages upon completion.

7. **Balance and Playtesting**: After assigning CP values to mission cards, playtest them rigorously to ensure that the CP distribution is balanced and that mission challenges are achievable but not too easy. Adjust CP values based on playtesting results to maintain fairness and fun gameplay.

8. **CP Adjustments for Passive and Single-Use Abilities**: Consider how the passive and single-use abilities of mission cards might impact CP distribution. If these abilities provide significant advantages, you may need to adjust the CP cost of the mission card accordingly to maintain balance.

9. **Consistency in CP Allocation**: Maintain consistency in CP allocation across mission cards to ensure a fair and balanced experience for players. Avoid drastic variations in CP costs unless the thematic elements and challenges justify such differences.

## Difficulty Scaling and Thematic Elements

Domain points assigned to the card dictate how demanding the challenge is and how consequential the rewards are.

One domain point should be an easy challenge. 2 points would be an intermediate challenge. 3-4 points should be an advanced challenge. 5-6 points should be highly challenging. The points come from the sum of all domain points used on the card. If a card has 1 point in Technology and 2 points in Psionics, that would be 3 points for the challenge.

Each mission card should not only present a challenge but also immerse players in the thematic elements associated with the chosen domains. Here are some clarifications and examples:

- Technology: If you allocate domain points to Technology, consider challenges that involve advanced gadgets, inventions, or strategic maneuvers. The thematic elements should revolve around technological advancements and innovation.
  - Example Challenge for 3 Technology Points: "In a single turn, deploy three `Mech` units and clear the opponent's front line of at least five units."
- Magic: For Magic domain points, challenges should tap into mystical and arcane themes. Think of challenges that require spellcasting, enchantments, or harnessing magical energies.
  - Example Challenge for 4 Magic Points: "Conjure a magical barrier that protects your units from at least 4 attacks for one turn."
- Psionics: Psionics should evoke psychic and mental abilities. Challenges can involve manipulating thoughts, foreseeing events, or exerting cognitive control.
  - Example Challenge for 2 Psionics Points: "In a single turn, force your opponent to discard 3 cards."
- Divinity: Divinity should encompass divine and spiritual themes. Challenges may involve divine blessings, celestial interventions, or acts of faith.
  - Example Challenge for 2 Divinity Points: "Receive a divine blessing that doubles the strength of one of your units for a turn."

## Challenges

Every mission card must present a specific challenge that the player must complete. The complexity of the challenge is determined by the total number of domain points used on the card, with higher points leading to more complex challenges. These challenges may involve multiple steps and items to complete.

## Passive Ability

Each mission card comes with a passive ability that activates upon mission completion. This ability triggers at the start of each subsequent turn. The power of this ability scales with the difficulty of the mission and the total domain points on the card.

### Passive Ability Examples

## Single-Use Ability

In addition to the passive ability, each mission card provides a single-use ability that automatically triggers when the mission is completed. This ability's strength also scales based on the mission's difficulty and domain points.
