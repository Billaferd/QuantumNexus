| Psionic Network Expansion    | 10 |     1      |   0    |     3     |     0     | Take control of an opponent's Unit with at least 4 Attack.                  | At the start of each turn, look at your opponent's hand.                                                                         | Choose an enemy Unit. It cannot attack or block until the end of your next turn.                                                       | "Our network expands, assimilating knowledge and power from every corner of the galaxy."                                        | * **Action:** Tendrils of glowing blue energy extend from a central Ferro-Sapien processing unit, wrapping around an enemy unit and interfacing with its systems. The enemy unit's eyes glow with the same blue light as its movements become erratic and controlled. <br> * **Subject:** The Ferro-Sapien processing unit is a massive, complex structure of metallic panels, glowing circuitry, and pulsating energy cores. It resembles a metallic brain, symbolizing the vast computational power and psionic network of the Ferro-Sapiens. <br> * **Background:** The background is a dark void of space, with distant stars and nebulae providing a faint backdrop. The encroaching tendrils of energy represent the ever-expanding reach of the Ferro-Sapien network. | Ferro-Sapiens |
| Technological Singularity  |  0 |     1      |   0    |     0     |     0     | Have 5 Tech Units on the battlefield at the start of your turn.               | Your Tech Units have "Barrier 1" (The first time this unit would be discarded each turn, prevent it and remove all Barrier counters from this unit). | Choose a Tech Unit you control. All Tech units you control gain its passive abilities until the end of your turn.                  | "The culmination of eons of self-evolution. Pure technological transcendence."                                                   | * **Action:** A massive network of interconnected Ferro-Sapien machines pulsates with energy, their forms shifting and merging as they reach a critical threshold of technological complexity. A blinding white light emanates from the network, signifying a breakthrough in their evolution. <br> * **Subject:** The network of machines is a chaotic yet organized collection of metallic limbs, glowing circuitry, and spinning energy cores. Each individual unit is seamlessly integrated into the larger whole, forming a collective consciousness of pure technological power. <br> * **Background:** The background is a stark, minimalist environment of white space, emphasizing the singularity of the Ferro-Sapiens' technological achievement. The absence of any other elements highlights the self-contained nature of their evolution.  | Ferro-Sapiens |
| Networked Adaptability      |  3 |     0      |   0    |     1     |     0     | Have a Psionic Unit with "Immunity" deal damage 4 times.                    | Choose a friendly and an enemy unit. The friendly unit gains the enemy unit's Attack until the end of the turn.                | Look at the top three cards of your deck. Draw one and discard the rest.                                                                  | "Data flows through our network, anticipating threats and adapting our strategies."                                               | * **Action:** A Ferro-Sapien unit stands amidst a chaotic battle, tendrils of psionic energy emanating from its core and interfacing with surrounding allied units. The tendrils transmit data and tactical information, allowing for coordinated and adaptive maneuvers. <br> * **Subject:** The Ferro-Sapien unit is a sleek, humanoid machine with glowing blue circuitry and intricate mechanical limbs. Its design emphasizes agility and precision, reflecting its role as a psionic conduit and tactical coordinator. <br> * **Background:** The background is a blurred cityscape, with explosions and laser fire illuminating the sky. The remnants of destroyed buildings and vehicles litter the streets, creating a sense of urgency and conflict. | Ferro-Sapiens |
