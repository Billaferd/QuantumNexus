### **Quantum Nexus: Comprehensive Deck Construction Guide**

Deck construction in Quantum Nexus is a fundamental aspect of gameplay that requires strategic thinking and careful planning. Your deck is your primary tool for outmaneuvering opponents and achieving victory. This guide will cover all the essential rules and strategies for building a powerful and cohesive deck.

### **I. Construction Basics**

The foundation of your Quantum Nexus deck lies in adhering to specific structural requirements:

* **Main Deck CP Limit:** Your main deck (excluding Mission Cards) **must contain exactly 200 Command Points (CP) worth of cards.** This total includes the CP cost of all Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards.  
  * Each card of these types has a CP value displayed in its top-left corner.  
  * Mission cards do **not** count towards this 200 CP limit.  
* **Leader Subtype CP Limit:** Within the 200 CP total for your main deck, **no more than 25 CP may be allocated to cards with the 'Leader' subtype.**  
* **Deck Size:** There is no specific minimum or maximum number of individual cards in your main deck, as long as the total CP is exactly 200 and you adhere to any duplicate limits printed on individual cards.

### **II. Mission Cards**

Mission cards are crucial for defining your objectives and influencing your overall strategy.

* **Maximum Mission Cards:** Your deck can include a maximum of **six mission cards**.  
* **Total Domain Points:** Mission cards are associated with six domains: **Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity, Biology, and Entropy.** The total points across all domains on your chosen mission cards **must equal exactly 6**.  
* **Single Domain Limit:** No single domain on your mission cards can have more than **4 points**. This encourages diversification of objectives.  
* **Zero Points Allowed:** It is permissible to have a domain with 0 points on your mission cards, allowing for flexible deck-building.  
* **Mission-Derived Command Points:** The combined CP value of your chosen mission cards determines a base amount of Command Points you will gain at the start of each Game Round. This value is determined during initial game setup.

### **III. Play Cards and Domain Alignment**

Play cards are the core of your forces and must align with your chosen mission card domains.

* **Matching or Lower Domain Values:** Each card has domain values. When including a card in your deck, its domain value for any given domain (e.g., Technology) **must be equal to or lower than the total number of points assigned to that same domain across all of your chosen Mission cards.**  
  * For example, if your collective Mission cards grant a total of 3 points in the Technology domain, any card in your deck cannot have more than 3 points in its Technology domain value.  
  * If a card has values in multiple domains, this check must be satisfied for each of those domains against the corresponding total from your Mission Cards.  
  * Crucially, if your Mission cards provide a total of 0 points for a specific domain, you cannot include any card in your deck that has a value greater than 0 in that same domain.  
* **Duplicate Limits:** Always adhere to the duplicate limits printed on each card. You can have fewer than the limit, but never more.

### **IV. Initial Game Setup (Pre-Game Deck Actions)**

Before the game begins, specific actions related to deck construction are performed:

* **Mission Card Placement:** Identify your chosen Mission Cards from your constructed deck. Separate them from your main deck and place them face-up in your Mission Card Area. They are **not** part of the main deck used for the initiative flip.  
* **Determine Base Mission CP Value:** Sum the CP values of your Mission Cards now in your Mission Card Area. This total is your base CP value derived from Mission Cards for the game and will contribute to your Command Point pool each Game Round.

### **V. Advanced Deck Building Strategies**

Beyond the basic rules, refining your deck involves strategic considerations:

* **Metagame Analysis and Tech Choices:**  
  * Analyze the current popular decks and strategies in the Quantum Nexus community.  
  * Include "tech choices"â€”cards specifically designed to counter prevalent threats in the metagame. These cards might not always be universally strong but can be critical in specific matchups.  
* **Curve Optimization:**  
  * A well-balanced "curve" (the distribution of CP costs of cards in your deck) is crucial.  
  * Aim for a smooth progression of card costs to ensure you have plays available at various CP costs, allowing you to effectively utilize your CP throughout the Activation Sequence of a Game Round. This helps maintain pressure and options at every stage of the game.

**Sideboarding:**

This is the practice of fine-tuning your deck between games in a match.

By swapping specific cards from a pre-determined sideboard, you can adapt your strategy to better counter your current opponent's deck.For the complete rules on sideboard construction and usage, see the **`Detailed Rules`, Section II.D**.

**Deck Archetypes:**

Quantum Nexus supports various playstyles, each with distinct characteristics:

* **Aggro:** Focuses on overwhelming opponents with early aggression and efficient attacks.  
  * **Control:** Aims to outlast opponents through disruption, defensive plays, and resource denial.  
  * **Combo:** Seeks to execute powerful combinations of cards for devastating effects.  
  * **Midrange:** Strikes a balance between aggression and control, adapting to the flow of the game.  
  * Experiment with different archetypes to find one that suits your playstyle and the current metagame.  
* **Continuous Improvement:**  
  * Deck building is an ongoing process. The metagame evolves, new cards are released, and your understanding of the game deepens.  
  * Continuously test, refine, and adapt your deck based on your experiences and the ever-changing landscape of Quantum Nexus.

### **VI. Building Your First Deck (Practical Steps)**

* **Core Card Selection:**  
  * Start by choosing versatile and efficient cards that form the foundation of your deck.  
  * Consider a mix of unit cards for combat, asset cards for support, and event cards for tactical flexibility during the Activation Sequence.  
* **Synergy and Theme:**  
  * As you expand, look for cards that complement your core and create powerful synergies.  
  * This could involve focusing on a specific domain (e.g., all your units have Technology domain points and you have a strong Technology mission), utilizing cards with shared keywords or abilities, or building around a particular strategy (e.g., a deck focused on disrupting the opponent's hand).  
  * A well-themed deck with strong synergies will be more consistent and effective.  
* **Testing and Refinement:**  
  * Successful deck building requires time and experimentation.  
  * Test different card combinations against various opponents.  
  * Analyze your wins and losses to understand what works and what doesn't.  
  * Learn from your experiences and adjust your deck accordingly.  
* **Seeking Advice:**  
  * The Quantum Nexus community is a valuable resource.  
  * Don't hesitate to seek advice from experienced players, browse online forums, and participate in community discussions. You can find decklists, strategy guides, and helpful tips from fellow enthusiasts.

By carefully considering these aspects of deck construction, you'll be well-equipped to build competitive and enjoyable decks for Quantum Nexus.
