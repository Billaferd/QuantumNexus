# Quantum Nexus: Player's Turn Quick Reference

This document outlines the sequence of a Game Round, focusing on the actions and decisions a player makes.

## 1\. Start of Round Step (Simultaneous for All Players)

This step happens at the beginning of every Game Round. All players perform these actions at the same time.

### a. Simultaneous Refresh Actions

1.  Deactivate All Cards: Ready all of your exhausted cards.
    
2.  Gain Command Points (CP): Reset your CP to zero, then gain CP equal to the total CP value of your Mission cards, plus any bonuses from other card effects.
    
3.  Draw Cards: Draw until you have five cards in your hand.
    
4.  Apply the Passive Abilities on your Mission Cards.

### b. Resolve Triggered Abilities

1.  Action-Contingent Triggers: Resolve any abilities that were triggered by the refresh actions (e.g., "when you draw a card"). The player with initiative resolves all of their triggers first, then play proceeds clockwise.
    
2.  "Start of Round" Triggers: After the above are finished, resolve any abilities that trigger "at the start of the round." The player with initiative resolves theirs first, followed by other players in turn order.

## 2\. Activation Sequence (Alternating Single Actions)

After the Start of Round Step, players take turns performing a single action, starting with the player who has initiative. After an action is fully resolved, the turn passes to the next player clockwise. This continues until all players pass consecutively.

### Available Single Actions

On your turn, choose ONE of the following actions:

Core Actions (Cost CP)

*   Deploy a Card: Pay the card's CP cost and place it into play.

*   Units/Terrain: Place in a quadrant on your side of the Battlefield.

*   Assets: Place in your Loadout Area.

*   Upgrades: Attach to a valid card you control.

*   Activate an Active Ability: Choose one of your cards in play, pay the ability's costs (CP, exhausting the card, etc.), and resolve its effect.

*   Play an Event Card: Pay the Event's CP cost from your hand, resolve its effect, and then place it in your Discard Pile.

*   Combat & Movement Actions

    *   Declare an Attack:

        1.  Choose one of your ready units and exhaust it.
        
        2.  Declare a valid target enemy unit within the attacker's range.
        
        3.  Calculate the Defender's Effective Defense:

            *   Base Defense +
        
            *   +1 if the unit is in the Back Row.
        
            *   +/- any other modifiers from card effects.

        4.  Resolve Combat:

            *   If Attacker's Attack > Defender's Defense: The defending unit is destroyed (and sent to the Discard Pile, unless removed from the game by an effect like Nullify).
        
            *   If Attacker's Attack = Defender's Defense: The defending unit becomes Suppressed.
        
            *   If Attacker's Attack < Defender's Defense: The attack has no effect. The defender is unaffected.

*   Move a Unit:

    1.  Choose one of your ready units.
        
    2.  Move it to an adjacent friendly quadrant (Forward, Backward, Left, or Right).
        
    3.  The unit becomes exha# Quantum Nexus: Player's Turn Quick Reference
