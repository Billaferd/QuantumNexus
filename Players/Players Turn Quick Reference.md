# **Quantum Nexus: Player's Turn Quick Reference**

This document outlines the sequence of a Game Round, focusing on the actions and decisions a player makes.

## **1\. Start of Round Step (Simultaneous for All Players)**

This step happens at the beginning of every Game Round. All players perform these actions at the same time.

### **a. Simultaneous Refresh Actions**

1. **Deactivate All Cards:** Ready all of your exhausted cards.  
2. **Gain Command Points (CP):** Reset your CP to zero, then gain CP equal to the total CP value of your Mission cards, plus any bonuses from other card effects.  
3. **Draw Cards:** Draw until you have five cards in your hand.

### **b. Resolve Triggered Abilities**

All abilities triggered during the Start of Round Step are resolved using the **Priority Chain**.

1. **Build the Chain:** The player with initiative adds their triggers, then opponents add theirs.  
2. **Response Window:** In turn order, each player gets **one chance** to add a response trigger.  
3. **Resolve the Chain:** Resolve abilities from last-in to first-out (top-down).

*(For full details, see Section VII in the Detailed Rules.)*

## **2\. Activation Sequence (Alternating Single Actions)**

After the Start of Round Step, players take turns performing a single action, starting with the player who has initiative. After an action is fully resolved, the turn passes to the next player clockwise. This continues until all players pass consecutively.

### **Available Single Actions**

On your turn, choose **ONE** of the following actions:

**Core Actions (Cost CP)**

* **Deploy a Card:** Pay the card's CP cost and place it into play.  
  * **Units/Terrain:** Place in a quadrant on your side of the Battlefield.  
  * **Assets:** Place in your Loadout Area.  
  * **Upgrades:** Attach to a valid card you control.  
* **Activate an Active Ability:** Choose one of your cards in play, pay the ability's costs (CP, exhausting the card, etc.), and resolve its effect.  
* **Play an Event Card:** Pay the Event's CP cost from your hand, resolve its effect, and then place it in your Discard Pile.

**Combat & Movement Actions**

* **Declare an Attack:**  
  1. Choose one of your ready units and **exhaust** it.  
  2. Declare a valid target enemy unit within the attacker's range.  
  3. Calculate the Defender's **Effective Defense**:  
     * Base Defense \+  
     * \+1 if the unit is in the Back Row.  
     * \+/- any other modifiers from card effects.  
  4. **Resolve Combat:**  
     * **If Attacker's Attack \> Defender's Defense:** The defending unit is destroyed (and sent to the Discard Pile, unless removed from the game by an effect like Nullify).  
     * **If Attacker's Attack \= Defender's Defense:** The defending unit becomes **Suppressed**.  
     * **If Attacker's Attack \< Defender's Defense:** **The attack has no effect.** The defender is unaffected.  
* **Move a Unit:**  
  1. Choose one of your ready units.  
  2. Move it to an adjacent friendly quadrant (Forward, Backward, Left, or Right).  
  3. The unit becomes **exhausted**.

**Passing Actions**

* **Pass:** Take no action. The round ends when all players Pass in a row.

Interrupts & Activated Events

Some Event cards have 'Trigger' abilities that allow you to Activate them from your hand outside of your turn. When this happens, the game pauses and a new Priority Chain begins.

## **3\. Winning the Game**

You win the game at the end of a round if both of these conditions are true:

* You have at least one unit in each of your three Front Row quadrants.  
* Your opponent has no units in any of their three Front Row quadrants.
