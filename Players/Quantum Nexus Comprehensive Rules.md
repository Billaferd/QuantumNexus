# Enhanced Quantum Nexus Comprehensive Rules

## 100. General

*   **100.1.** These Quantum Nexus rules apply to any Quantum Nexus game with two or more players. 
*   **100.2a** In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each deck has a minimum deck size of **200 CP**. 
*   **100.2b** No more than **25 CP** can be dedicated to Leader type units.
*   **100.2c** The domain points on all mission cards must not total more than 6, and no single domain can total more than 4. 
*   **100.2d** The cards in the deck must adhere to the duplicate attributes printed on each card. 
*   **100.2e** The specified domain points on a card must be equal to or less than the total domain points on the mission cards.
*   **100.3.** Some cards and casual variants require additional items, such as specialized dice.

## 101. The Quantum Nexus Golden Rules

*   **101.1.** Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence.
*   **101.2.** If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously.

## 102. Players

*   **102.1.** Quantum Nexus games involve two or more players.
*   **102.2.** Each player is an opponent of all other players.

## 103. Starting the Game 

*   **103.1.** Before the game begins, players construct their decks according to the deck construction rules (see 100.2). 
*   **103.2.** Players determine the starting player randomly. This player takes the first turn.
*   **103.3** Each player shuffles their deck so the cards are in random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponent's decks. The players' decks become their libraries. 

## 104. Ending the Game

*   **104.1.** A player wins the game if one of the following conditions is met: 
    *   **104.1a** An opponent is unable to draw a card when required (Deck Depletion).
    *   **104.1b** The player completes all of their mission cards (Mission Completion).

## 105. Domains

*   **105.1** There are four domains in Quantum Nexus: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. 
*   **105.2** Unit cards can be associated with one or more domains. 
*   **105.3** Mission cards are associated with the four domains, and the total domain points on a player's mission cards must equal 6.

## 106. Command Points (CP)

*   **106.1.** Command Points (CP) are a resource used to deploy units and activate certain abilities.
*   **106.2.** Each card has a CP value indicated in the top left corner. 
*   **106.3.** Players start the game with a certain amount of CP, determined by the total CP value of their chosen mission cards. This amount increases each turn.

## 107. Battlefield

*   **107.1.** The battlefield is divided into six quadrants. 
*   **107.2.** Units are deployed into specific quadrants. 
*   **107.3.** Some card abilities affect units in specific quadrants.

## 108. Cards

*   **108.1.** A card is any of the game components that are printed on cardboard and measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm).
*   **108.2** A card does not have a controller unless it represents a unit or asset; in those cases, its controller is determined by the rules for those cards. 
*   **108.3** If anything asks for the controller of a card that doesn’t have one (because it’s not a unit or asset), use its owner instead. 

## 109. Objects

*   **109.1** An object is a card, a token, a copy of a card, or a copy of a spell or ability.

## 110. Card Types

* **110.1. Unit Cards:** Unit cards represent characters, creatures, or machines that can attack and defend. They are the primary means of combat and have Attack and Health values. Units are deployed onto the battlefield and can be affected by various card abilities and effects.
* **110.2. Leader Cards:** Leader cards are a specialized type of unit card with unique abilities that can significantly impact the game. They are subject to a dedicated CP limit during deck construction, signifying their strategic importance.
* **110.3. Asset Cards:** Asset cards provide ongoing benefits or special abilities from a designated play area outside the battlefield. They represent resources, technologies, or other strategic advantages that players can utilize throughout the game.
* **110.4. Upgrade Cards:** Upgrade cards can be attached to units to enhance their capabilities. They may provide additional attack power, defensive bonuses, or special abilities that modify the unit's function on the battlefield.
* **110.5. Event Cards:** Event cards represent one-time actions or effects that can be played from the hand. They offer immediate impact on the game state and are discarded after their effect resolves.
* **110.6. Terrain Cards:** Terrain cards modify the battlefield by affecting units within specific quadrants. They introduce dynamic elements to the game, influencing unit positioning and combat strategies.
* **110.7. Mission Cards:** Mission cards represent a player's objectives during the game. They can have passive effects or powerful abilities that are activated upon completion. Completing all mission cards is one way to win the game.

## 111. Tokens

## 113. Abilities

*   **113.2. Triggered Abilities:** Triggered abilities activate automatically when their specific trigger conditions are met. These conditions could involve events on the battlefield, actions taken by players, or reaching certain game states. When the condition is met, the triggered ability resolves, performing its stated effect. 
*   **113.3. Passive Abilities:** Passive abilities are always in effect and require no activation. They provide continuous benefits or modifiers to the card they are printed on or affect other game elements based on their specific text.

## 120. Combat

* **120.1. Attack Range:** Each Unit card has a defined attack range (Close, Mid, or Far), indicating the quadrants from which it can attack. A unit can only attack units within its range. 
* **120.2. Attacking:** During the Battle Phase, a player can choose to attack with any of their ready units. The player declares the attacking unit and the target unit they wish to attack. 
* **120.3. Blocking:** The defending player can choose to block the attack with one of their own ready units in the same quadrant as the attacking unit. If no block is declared, the attacking unit deals damage to the defending player directly.
