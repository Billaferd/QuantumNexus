# Quantum Nexus Comprehensive Rules

## 100. General

*   **100.1.** These Quantum Nexus rules apply to any Quantum Nexus game with two or more players.
*   **100.2a** In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each deck has a minimum deck size of **200 CP**.
*   **100.2b** No more than **25 CP** can be dedicated to Leader type units. 
*   **100.2c** The domain points on all mission cards must not total more than 6, and no single domain can total more than 4. 
*   **100.2d** The cards in the deck must adhere to the duplicate attributes printed on each card.
*   **100.2e** The specified domain points on a card must be equal to or less than the total domain points on the mission cards.
*   **100.3.** Some cards and casual variants require additional items, such as specialized dice.

## 101. The Quantum Nexus Golden Rules

*   **101.1.** Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. [This rule is not from the sources, but a common principle in card games, including Magic: The Gathering.]
*   **101.2.** If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. [This is derived from the "initiative" concept in Quantum Nexus and the "Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order" rule in Magic: The Gathering. - 166, 8]

## 102. Players

*   **102.1.** Quantum Nexus games involve two or more players. 
*   **102.2.** Each player is an opponent of all other players.

## 103. Starting the Game 

*   **103.1.** Before the game begins, players construct their decks according to the deck construction rules (see 100.2).
*   **103.2.** Players determine the starting player randomly. This player takes the first turn.
*   **103.3** Each player shuffles their deck so the cards are in random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponent's decks. The players' decks become their libraries.

## 104. Ending the Game

*   **104.1.** A player wins the game if one of the following conditions is met: 
    *   **104.1a** An opponent is unable to draw a card when required (Deck Depletion). 
    *   **104.1b** The player completes all of their mission cards (Mission Completion). 

## 105. Domains

*   **105.1** There are four domains in Quantum Nexus: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. 
*   **105.2** Unit cards can be associated with one or more domains.
*   **105.3** Mission cards are associated with the four domains, and the total domain points on a player's mission cards must equal 6.

## 106. Command Points (CP)

*   **106.1.** Command Points (CP) are a resource used to deploy units and activate certain abilities.
