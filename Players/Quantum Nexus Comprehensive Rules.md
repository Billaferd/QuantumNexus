## **102. Areas of Play**

*   **102.1 Mission Card Area:** 
    *   **102.1a Location and Purpose:** Situated prominently above the main playing area, the Mission Card Area provides a dedicated space for players to display their chosen mission cards face-up. 
    *   **102.1b Visibility and Reference:** The face-up placement of mission cards allows for transparency, enabling both players to readily see each other's objectives and strategize accordingly.  Players can refer to these cards throughout the game to track their progress and make informed decisions aligned with their victory goals.

*   **102.2 Deck:**
    *   **102.2a Starting Point:**  The Deck represents each player's personalized arsenal, containing a carefully constructed set of cards shuffled and placed face-down in a designated area at the game's start.
    *   **102.2b Drawing Cards:**  Players draw cards from their Deck throughout the game, primarily during the Ready Phase, to replenish their hand and access new tactical options.
    *   **102.2c Deck Depletion:** Running out of cards carries significant consequences in Quantum Nexus. If a player is unable to draw a card when required, their Deck is considered empty, and they lose the game.  This mechanic highlights the importance of resource management, strategic card usage, and planning for long-term sustainability.

*   **102.3 Discard Pile:**
    *   **102.3a Repository for Used Cards:** The Discard Pile acts as a repository for cards that are no longer active in the game. 
    *   **102.3b Reasons for Discarding:** Cards are typically sent to the Discard Pile when they are destroyed in battle, their effects have been used, or specific game mechanics necessitate their removal.
    *   **102.3c Face-Up Placement:** Cards in the Discard Pile are placed face-up, allowing both players to see which cards have been used, eliminated, and are potentially out of circulation. This open visibility contributes to strategic awareness and informed decision-making for both players. 

*   **102.4 Loadout Area:**
    *   **102.4a Dedicated Asset Zone:** The Loadout Area is a specialized zone outside the main battlefield designated for placing Asset cards.
    *   **102.4b Asset Protection:** Unlike Units deployed directly onto the battlefield, Assets placed in the Loadout Area enjoy a degree of protection from direct attacks by enemy Units.   This strategic positioning makes them valuable assets capable of providing sustained benefits throughout the game.
    *   **102.4c Vulnerability to Specific Effects:**  While safe from direct Unit attacks, it's important to note that Assets in the Loadout Area can still be targeted and affected by certain card abilities or effects explicitly designed to interact with this zone.
    *   **102.4d Ongoing Effects and Abilities:**  Assets often provide continuous passive effects or activate powerful abilities that can significantly impact the game state, making them valuable strategic components within a player's overall strategy. 

*   **102.5 Battlefield:**
    *   **102.5a Central Arena for Conflict:**  The Battlefield is the central playing area where Units are strategically deployed, maneuvered, and engage in direct combat.  It's a dynamic space where tactical decisions and card interactions play out, shaping the course of the game.
    *   **102.5b Quadrant Divisions:**  For strategic depth and tactical considerations, the Battlefield is subdivided into six distinct quadrants: Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Back Left, Back Center, and Back Right.
    *   **102.5c Front Row and Back Row:**  The battlefield is also split horizontally. The Front left, front center, and front right quadrants make up the front row. The back row is made up of the back left, back center, and back right quadrants.
    *   **102.5d Flanks and Center:** The Battlefield layout is also strategically categorized into flanks and the center. The Front Left and Back Left quadrants form the left flank, the Front Right and Back Right constitute the right flank, and the Front Center and Back Center represent the central area of the battlefield.  This division adds another layer of tactical thinking, encouraging players to consider flank attacks, central control, and defensive formations. 
    *   **102.5e Attack Ranges and Positioning:**  Each Unit card has a designated range—Close, Mid, or Far—which dictates the specific quadrants it can attack from its current position.   Strategic positioning, understanding attack ranges, and anticipating opponent's movements are key to successful combat on the Quantum Nexus battlefield. 
*  **102.6 Ranges:**
    *  **102.6a Close Range:** Close Range units can attack in the cardinal directions (Up, Down,Left, and right), so long as there is a quadrant there.
    *  **102.6b Mid Range:** Mid range units includes all close range targets plus the quadrants that are on the diagonal from the unit as long as there is a quadrant there.
    *  **102.6c Far Range:** Far Range can target  all quadrants that are one quadrant away. If the unit is in the back left quadrant then it can target the back right, front right, the opponent's front left, front center, and front right.

## 103. Setting up the Game

*   **103.1 Constructed Decks:** Before the game begins, players must construct their decks according to the rules in **Section 100**. This ensures a fair and balanced game.

*   **103.2 Determining the Starting Player:**
    *   **103.2a Card Comparison:** This can be done by having each player draw a card from their shuffled deck and comparing their CP values. The player with the lower CP value chooses who goes first. 
        *   **103.2b Tiebreaker:** If the CP values are equal, players draw additional cards until a lower value is revealed.

*   **103.3 Shuffling and Cutting Decks:** 
    *   **103.3a Shuffling:** Each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are in random order.
    *   **103.3b Cutting:** Players may then shuffle or cut their opponent's decks.
    *   **103.3c Libraries:** The shuffled decks become each player's army.

*   **103.4 Mission Card Placement:**
    *   **103.4a Selection:** Each player selects their chosen mission cards from their deck.
    *   **103.4b Placement:** Players place their mission cards face-up in the designated Mission Card Area. This makes the objectives visible to both players.

*   **103.5 Starting Command Points:**
    *   **103.5a Calculation:** Players determine their starting Command Points (CP) based on the total CP value of their chosen mission cards. 
    *   **103.5b Total CP:** Add the CP values of all mission cards together.  This sum is the player's starting CP. 

## 104. Ending the Game

*   **104.1.** A player wins the game if one of the following conditions is met: 
    *   **104.1a** An opponent is unable to draw a card when required (Deck Depletion).
    *   **104.1b** The player completes all of their mission cards (Mission Completion).

## 105. Combat

*   **105.1 Attack Range**: Each Unit card has a defined attack range: Close, Mid, or Far. A unit can only attack units within its range. Attack range dictates the quadrants a unit can attack from its current position.

    *   **105.1a Close Range**: Close Range units can attack in the cardinal directions (Up, Down, Left, and Right), so long as there is a quadrant there.
    *   **105.1b Mid Range**: Mid Range units can attack all Close Range targets, plus the quadrants that are diagonal to the unit, as long as there is a quadrant there.
    *   **105.1c Far Range**: Far Range units can target all quadrants that are one quadrant away. If the unit is in the back left quadrant, then it can target the back right, front right, the opponent's front left, front center, and front right.
*   **105.2 Attacking**: During the Battle Phase, a player can choose to attack with any of their ready units. The player declares the attacking unit and the target unit they wish to attack. Units in the front row must be targeted and defeated before attacking units in the back row.

*   **105.3a Damage Resolution:** When a unit attacks, it deals damage equal to its Attack value to the defending unit.

*   **105.3b Attack Comparison:** The attacker's Attack value is compared to the defender's Defense value.

*   **105.3c Defender's Defeat**: If the attacker's Attack value is higher than the defender's Defense value, the defender is destroyed.
*   **105.3d Attacker's Defeat:** If the defender's Defense value is higher than the attacker's Attack value, the attacker is destroyed.
*   **105.3e Draw:** If the Attack and Defense values are equal, both units remain on the battlefield.

*   **105.4 Defeat:** "Defeat" and "Destroy" both mean that a unit is removed from the battlefield. A unit is defeated if the attacker's attack value is greater than the unit's defense value. Defeated units are removed from the battlefield. [100.10, 122.1] 

## **106. Abilities**

#### 106.4d. Trigger Conditions

106.4d.i. Each triggered ability has a specific **trigger condition** that must be met for the ability to activate.

106.4d.ii. These conditions are clearly defined in the card's text.

106.4d.iii. Recognizing these triggers is crucial for anticipating and responding to their activation.

#### 106.4e. Timing

106.4e.i The timing of a triggered ability's activation is important.

106.4e.ii. Some abilities trigger immediately when the condition is met, while others may trigger at a specific point in the game, such as at the start or end of a phase.

#### 106.4f. Resolution

106.4f.i. Once a triggered ability's condition is met, its effect resolves as instructed by the card's text.

106.4f.ii. This could involve various game actions, similar to activated abilities.

### 106.5. Passive Abilities

106.5a. **Passive abilities** are continuously active without requiring any activation.

106.5b. These abilities provide ongoing benefits or modifiers to the card they are associated with or affect other game elements as outlined in their text.
