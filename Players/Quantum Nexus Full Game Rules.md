# Note to Players

This rulebook is a comprehensive guide to playing Quantum Nexus, providing the foundational rules for the game. While this rulebook aims to be complete, Quantum Nexus is an evolving game. Quantum Nexus is made of many interconnected systems and it may take a while to learn it. There is a Quantum Nexus Quick Start Guide, to ease new players into the game with a limited rule set. When those are understood, we recommend moving on to this rule book for the full experience.

# I. Introduction to Quantum Nexus

## A. Game Overview

Quantum Nexus is an exhilarating sci-fi trading card game that transports players into a world of strategic battles between advanced civilizations. Players build decks of cards representing various units, leaders, and powerful events to outmaneuver their opponents. The game requires strategic thinking, tactical decision-making, and a deep understanding of card interactions to achieve victory. Quantum Nexus can be played by two or more players, with two being the most common configuration. In multiplayer games, players are typically arranged in a circle, and turns proceed in clockwise order.
The objective of Quantum Nexus is to defeat your opponent by either:
- Forcing them to draw a card when their deck is empty, or
- Completing all of your mission cards.

## B. Components

To play Quantum Nexus, you will need the following components:
- Cards : These are the heart of the game, representing units, leaders, assets, events, upgrades, terrain, and missions. Each card has unique abilities and characteristics that contribute to your overall strategy.
- Mission Card Area : This designated area is where you place your mission cards face-up at the beginning of the game.
- Deck : This is where you keep your shuffled deck of cards, drawing from it during your turn.
- Discard Area : When cards are destroyed or used, they are placed face-up in this area.
- Loadout Area : This area is specifically for Asset cards, which have persistent effects throughout the game.
- Battlefield : This is the main playing area where units are deployed and battles take place. The battlefield is divided into quadrants, each contributing to unit positioning and tactical considerations.

## C. Card Attributes

Each card in Quantum Nexus has several key attributes:
- Command Points (CP) : Located in the top-left corner, CP indicates the cost of playing a card. You have a limited amount of CP each turn, so choosing which cards to play is crucial.
- Type : Cards are categorized into types such as Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, Terrain, or Mission. Each type has distinct functions and roles in the game.
- Subtype : Subtypes provide further details about a card, such as its affiliation, or special abilities.
- Rule Box : This section contains the card's abilities, effects, and any special conditions for using it. Understanding the rule box is essential for effective card play.
- Duplicates : Some cards have restrictions on how many copies you can include in your deck. This ensures deck diversity and strategic balance. By familiarizing yourself with these components and card attributes, you'll be well-equipped to embark on your Quantum Nexus journey and build powerful decks to challenge your opponents.

# Quantum Nexus: Core Principles

> * Card Text Overrides Rules: A card's specific text takes precedence over general game rules, unless a rule explicitly states it cannot be overridden (e.g., Section V.F regarding Player Areas and Card Control). If unsure, consult the official FAQ.
> * Precision Matters: Pay close attention to specific keywords and phrases like "target," "destroy," "may," "must," "up to," and "exactly," as they have precise game meanings.
> * Resolve Fully and In Order: Complete each game step and resolve each card effect fully one at a time. Follow the detailed rules for timing and priority, especially for triggered effects (see Section VII.A).
> * Your Space, Your Stuff: A player's cards, tokens, and components always remain in their own designated play areas and are only physically manipulated by their owner (see Section V.F).
> * Paths to Victory: Achieve victory by either completing all of your Mission Cards OR by forcing an opponent to attempt to draw a card when their deck is empty (see Section VI).

# II. Deck Construction

Construction Basics

In Quantum Nexus, deck construction is a critical aspect of gameplay. Your main deck (excluding Mission Cards) must contain exactly 200 Command Points (CP) worth of cards. This total includes the CP cost of all Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards in your deck. Each such card has a CP value displayed in the top left corner. When selecting these cards for your deck, you must ensure their total CP value adds up to exactly 200. Mission cards do not count towards this 200 CP limit; their CP values contribute to the Command Points calculated at the start of each turn (see Section II.B and III.C.1 for details on CP calculation during the Ready Phase). This restriction ensures balance and prevents players from overwhelming their opponents with too many powerful cards.
Within this 200 CP total, no more than 25 CP may be allocated to cards with the 'Leader' subtype (see Section VII.D).

## A. Deck Size

There is no specific minimum or maximum limit on the number of individual cards in your main deck, provided the total CP of these cards (Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards) is exactly 200 as detailed in Construction Basics, and you adhere to duplicate limits printed on each card. Mission cards are separated from the main deck at the very beginning of the game setup, before any shuffling for initiative occurs (see Section III.A).

## B. Mission Cards

Mission cards play a significant role in Quantum Nexus, representing your objectives during the game. Your deck can include a maximum of six mission cards. These cards not only grant victory points upon completion but also offer passive effects or powerful abilities.
- Total Domain Points : Mission cards are associated with four domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. The total points across all domains on your mission cards must equal exactly 6. This ensures a diverse set of objectives and prevents focusing on a single domain.
- Single Domain Limit : No single domain on your mission cards can have more than 4 points. This further promotes balance and encourages players to explore different strategies.
- Zero Points Allowed : It is acceptable to have a domain with 0 points on your mission cards. This allows flexibility in deck building and caters to different playstyles.
- Mission-Derived Command Points per Turn : The total CP value of your chosen mission cards determines a base amount of Command Points (CP) you will calculate during each of your Ready Phases (see Section III.C.1). For instance, if your mission cards have a combined CP value of 18, this value contributes to your CP calculation at the start of each of your turns.

## C. Unit Cards

Unit cards form the core of your army in Quantum Nexus. They are the ones that engage in combat and fulfill mission objectives. When selecting unit cards for your deck, it's crucial to align them with the domains represented on your mission cards.
- Matching or Lower Domain Values : Unit cards have domain values associated with them (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity). When including a unit card in your deck, its domain value for any given domain (e.g., Technology) must be equal to or lower than the total number of points assigned to that same domain across all of your chosen Mission cards. For instance, if your collective Mission cards grant a total of 3 points in the Technology domain, any Unit card in your deck cannot have more than 3 points in its Technology domain value. If a Unit card has values in multiple domains, this check must be satisfied for each of those domains against the corresponding total from your Mission Cards. Crucially, this means if your Mission cards provide a total of 0 points for a specific domain, you cannot include any Unit card in your deck that has a value greater than 0 in that same domain. There are duplicate limits printed on each card, no card may ever break these limits. They can have an amount of cards lower than the limit, but never higher. By carefully selecting mission cards and aligning your unit cards with their domains, you can create a cohesive and powerful deck that maximizes your chances of victory in Quantum Nexus.

# III. How to Play

## A. Initial Game Setup

Before determining turn order, players prepare for the game:
- Mission Card Placement : Each player identifies their chosen Mission Cards from their constructed deck. These cards are separated from their main deck and placed face-up in that player's Mission Card Area. This makes the objectives visible to all players and ensures Mission Cards are not part of the deck used for the initiative flip.
- Determine Base Mission CP Value : Players determine the base CP value they will derive from their Mission Cards each turn. This is done by summing the CP values of their Mission Cards (now in their Mission Card Area). This total is the base CP value derived from Mission Cards for the game and will be used in calculating their Command Point pool each Ready Phase (see Section III.C.1).

## B. Determining Turn Order (Initiative)

With Mission Cards set aside and base Mission CP value known, the next step is to determine who goes first. This sets the initial pace.
- Prepare Decks : Each player takes their main deck (which now excludes Mission Cards).
- Shuffle : All players thoroughly shuffle their main decks.
- Flip Top Card : Each player simultaneously flips over the top card of their main deck. The CP value of this revealed card (which will be a Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, or Terrain card) is used for comparison.
- Compare CP Values : The player with the lower CP value on their revealed card decides who takes the first turn.
- Tiebreaker : If multiple players reveal cards with the same lowest CP value, or if all players reveal cards with the same CP value, those players involved in the tie continue flipping additional cards from the top of their decks until one player reveals a lower CP value than the others in the tie-breaking flip. Revealed cards from previous tie-breaking flips are set aside by those players until the tie is broken.
- Reshuffle Decks : Once the starting player is decided, all players retrieve any cards revealed during the initiative flip process and thoroughly shuffle them back into their respective decks. This ensures the deck is randomized before the first turn's Ready Phase.
- First Turn Advantage : The game begins with the chosen player taking the first turn, and subsequent turns proceed clockwise. The player who goes first can gain an advantage by setting up their strategy early in the game.

## C. Phases of Play

Each player's turn in Quantum Nexus is divided into four distinct phases. Players alternate turns within some phases, allowing for strategic interactions and decision-making.

### Ready Phase

Ready Phase (Simultaneous) : In this phase, each player simultaneously performs the following actions:
- Deactivate Cards : Return any of your cards currently in an exhausted state (i.e., turned sideways from use in a previous turn) back to their ready state (upright orientation). This makes them available to perform actions again this turn.
- Draw Cards : Players draw cards from their deck until they have five cards in hand. This replenishes their options for the upcoming turn.
- Reset and Calculate Current Turn CP : At the start of the Ready Phase, each player's Command Point (CP) pool is first reset to zero. Then, players recalculate their CP for the current turn by summing:
    - The total CP value derived from their Mission Cards (as determined during initial game setup).
    - Any additional CP explicitly granted by ongoing card effects or abilities that state they apply "at the start of the turn" or "during the Ready Phase." This sum becomes their total CP pool for the current turn.
- Resolve Effects : If any card abilities or effects are triggered for one or more players during the Ready Phase (e.g., "at the start of the Ready Phase..." effects), they are resolved after all other Ready Phase actions (Deactivate Cards, Draw Cards, Reset and Calculate Current Turn CP) are completed by all players, but before the Deployment Phase begins.
    - On the first turn of the game : The player taking the first game turn (who won or was chosen by the winner of the initial initiative flip) resolves all of their triggered Ready Phase effects first, in an order of their choosing if multiple effects trigger for them. Then, the other player (or next player in clockwise order) resolves all of their triggered Ready Phase effects, in an order of their choosing if multiple effects trigger for them.
    - On subsequent turns : The player who will have initiative in the upcoming Deployment Phase (as determined by actions in the previous Battle Phase, see Section III.D) resolves all of their triggered Ready Phase effects first, in an order of their choosing if multiple effects trigger for them. Then, the other player (or next player in clockwise order) resolves all of their triggered Ready Phase effects, in an order of their choosing if multiple effects trigger for them. (See Section VII.A for general rules on resolving stacked effects).

### Deployment Phase

Deployment Phase (Alternating Turns) : This phase is where the action heats up as players deploy their units onto the battlefield.
- Alternate Placement : Players take turns, starting with the player who has initiative, placing one card at a time from their hand onto their own side of the battlefield. Each card has a CP cost, and players must have enough CP to deploy it. Cards are always deployed into the controlling player's own quadrants or specified areas (e.g., Loadout Area for Assets).
- Passing : A player can choose to pass their turn, indicating they have finished deploying cards for this phase.
- Simultaneous Passing to End Phase : If all players pass consecutively (meaning each player, starting with the player who has initiative and proceeding clockwise, chooses to pass their current opportunity to act in that round of turns), the phase ends, and the next phase begins.
- Initiative : Initiative for the Deployment Phase determines who places a card first.
    - On the first turn of the game, the player who was chosen to take the first game turn has initiative.
    - On subsequent turns, initiative is determined as described in Section III.D.

### Command Phase

Command Phase (Alternating Turns) : This phase focuses on activating card abilities and utilizing Event cards for tactical advantages.
- Activate Abilities : Players take turns, starting with the player who has initiative, activating the abilities of their deployed cards on their side of the battlefield. Each card may have multiple abilities with varying costs and effects. Activating an Active Ability requires paying its specified costs (like CP) and also requires exhausting the card (turning it sideways), unless the ability explicitly states otherwise. A card must be in a ready state to activate an ability that requires it to be exhausted. (See Glossary definition of Active Ability for phase restrictions).
- Play Events : Event cards can be played during this phase for one-time powerful effects. These cards are discarded after use.
- Passing : If a player has no more abilities to activate or Events to play, they can pass their turn.
- Simultaneous Passing to End Phase : If all players pass consecutively (meaning each player, starting with the player who has initiative and proceeding clockwise, chooses to pass their current opportunity to act in that round of turns), the phase ends, and the next phase begins.
- Initiative : The initiative of the Command Phase is won by the player who performed the fewest Initiative Actions (specifically, deploying cards) in the current turn's Deployment Phase. Each card deployed counts as one deployment for this purpose. Tiebreakers are detailed in Section III.D.

### Battle Phase

Battle Phase (Declaring Attacks) : The Battle Phase is where conflicts erupt as players direct their units to attack.
Declaring Attacks and Targeting Principles
The Battle Phase is where units engage in combat. It is important to distinguish between "targeting" and "declaring an attack." "Targeting" refers to the process by which a card's range or ability defines a pool of valid targets. "Declaring an attack" is the action of choosing one specific, valid target from that pool to be the defender in combat. When declaring an attack, players must adhere to several key principles:
- Range : Each unit's Attack Range (Close, Mid, or Far), as defined in the Glossary (Section VIII), dictates which quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield, or potentially on the attacking player's own side of the battlefield, it can target from its position within its own quadrants. This range defines the pool of potential targets. For precise definitions of directional terms such as 'Forward,' 'Backward,' 'Left,' and 'Right' used in range descriptions, please refer to the 'Directional Terms on the Battlefield' section in the Glossary (Section VIII).
- In a multiplayer game, when a player declares an attack, they must also declare which opponent they are targeting. For the purpose of any player's turn, their front row will always face every other player's front row when determining range and targeting against an opponent.
- Target Selection for Attack : The attacking player chooses one of their units (located in one of their own quadrants) to attack and an eligible unit as the defender. The defender must be chosen from the pool of valid targets defined by the attacker's range and any other relevant card effects. The eligibility of a defender is determined by the attacker's range (Close, Mid, Far) and the Front-Row Priority rule when attacking an opponent's units. If a player chooses to attack one of their own units (a "friendly unit"), that friendly unit must be a valid target according to the attacking unit's range (e.g., a unit with Close Range may target itself).
- Front-Row Priority : When attacking an opponent's units, units in that opponent's front row must generally be targeted and destroyed (or otherwise removed from the battlefield) before units in that opponent's back row (in the same column/flank of that opponent's battlefield) can be targeted by direct attacks originating from units. A direct attack—which is exclusively an attack declared during the Battle Phase using a unit's printed Attack (A) and Defense (D) statistics—must adhere to Front-Row Priority. However, any damage, destruction, or other effects caused by card abilities (such as those from Activated Abilities, Triggered Abilities, or Event cards) are not considered direct attacks for this purpose and therefore IGNORE Front-Row Priority, allowing them to affect back-row units even if front-row units are present, unless the ability itself explicitly states it follows Front-Row Priority. If such a direct attack targets a front-row unit but does not result in its destruction or removal (e.g., if Attack equals Defense, or if the unit is saved by another effect before damage resolves), that front-row unit continues to protect the back row according to this rule. This rule does not apply when a player chooses to attack their own friendly units.
    - Example of Front-Row Priority: Opponent controls Unit X in their Front Left quadrant and Unit Y in their Back Left quadrant.
        - If your Unit A declares a direct attack and Unit X is a valid target, you must target Unit X before Unit Y.
        - However, if you play an Event card that says, 'Destroy target unit in an opponent's Back Row,' you could use the Event's effect to destroy Unit Y, even if Unit X is still present, because the Event's effect is not a direct attack and explicitly targets the Back Row (thus ignoring Front-Row Priority unless the Event said otherwise).
- Player Areas : Attacks are generally directed at opposing units in the opponent's play area, respecting the specific range definitions. However, certain range definitions or card effects may allow a unit to target its own quadrants or units within them. A player's cards never leave their own play area to enter an opponent's.
- Declare Attacks : Players take turns, starting with the player who has initiative, declaring attacks. This involves choosing an attacker (one of their own units) and a defender (one of an opponent's units, or one of their own friendly units if it is a valid target as per the attacking unit's range). When a unit declares an attack, it becomes exhausted (turned sideways).
- Compare Attack and Defense : The attacking unit's Attack value (A) is compared to the defending unit's Defense value (D). Combat resolves as follows, regardless of whether the defending unit is friendly or opposing:
    - If A>D: The defending unit is destroyed. The attacking unit survives.
    - If D>A: The attacking unit is destroyed. The defending unit survives.
    - If A=D: Neither unit is destroyed; both remain on the battlefield.
- Passing : A player can choose to pass their turn, indicating they have finished declaring attacks for this phase.
- Simultaneous Passing to End Phase : If all players pass consecutively (meaning each player, starting with the player who has initiative and proceeding clockwise, chooses to pass their current opportunity to act in that round of turns), the phase ends, and the next phase (Ready Phase of the next turn) begins.
- Initiative : The initiative of the Battle Phase is won by the player who performed the fewest Initiative Actions (specifically, activating Active Abilities and playing Event cards) in the Command Phase. Each distinct instance of these actions counts as one towards this total. Tiebreakers are detailed in Section III.D.

## D. Turn Structure

Each player takes turns in Quantum Nexus, progressing through four distinct phases. Turns are dynamic, with actions alternating between players within certain phases, fostering strategic interaction and decision-making. The concept of initiative determines who acts first in a given phase.
Initiative: Determining Turn Order within Phases
Initiative determines which player acts first within the alternating phases (Deployment, Command, Battle). It is awarded based on actions taken in a specific previous phase, with the goal being efficiency.
- The exact types and count of Initiative Actions depend on which phase's initiative is being determined, as detailed in the rules for each phase (Section III.C – specifically referring to the defined subsets of Initiative Actions for each phase).
- Generally, the player who performed the fewest such relevant Initiative Actions (as specified for each phase in Section III.C) gains initiative.
- Tiebreaker : If players tie for the fewest relevant Initiative Actions in the previous phase, then the player who spent the fewest Command Points (CP) on those same relevant Initiative Actions in that phase has the initiative.
- Second Tiebreaker : If players also tie on CP spent on those relevant Initiative Actions, initiative is awarded to the player whose turn it was when the first pass was made in the uninterrupted, consecutive sequence of all-player passes that concluded the phase. (In simpler terms, the player who began the chain of passes that ended the phase gains initiative under this tiebreaker). The second part of this rule remains: If the consecutive passes occur before any player has taken an action in that phase (e.g., all players pass as their first action), initiative goes to the player who had initiative at the start of that phase.
    - Example of Second Tiebreaker Application: Player A (who had initiative in the preceding phase), Player B, and Player C are in the Command Phase, and initiative for the Battle Phase is being determined.
        - Player A activates an ability (1 Initiative Action, 2 CP spent).
        - Player B plays an Event card (1 Initiative Action, 3 CP spent).
        - Player C now passes.
        - Player A then passes.
        - Player B then passes. (All players have passed consecutively, so the Command Phase ends).
        - Scenario 1: Player A performed fewer Initiative Actions OR spent less CP than Player B. Player A gains initiative for the Battle Phase.
        - Scenario 2 (Illustrating Second Tiebreaker): Assume Player A had also spent 3 CP on their action. Both Player A and Player B would be tied on Initiative Actions (1 each) and CP spent (3 CP each). The second tiebreaker now applies. The sequence of passes that ended the phase was: C passed, then A passed, then B passed. Player C made the first pass in this uninterrupted, phase-ending sequence. Therefore, Player C would gain initiative for the Battle Phase.

### Exceptions

- Simultaneous Actions : In phases where all players act simultaneously (like the Ready Phase's core actions), there is no initiative in the traditional sense of determining who acts first within that phase's core simultaneous actions. However, the resolution order for triggered effects in the Ready Phase is determined by who is taking the first turn (on turn 1) or who has initiative for the upcoming Deployment Phase (on subsequent turns), as described in Section III.C.1.
- Deployment Phase (First Turn) : On the first turn of the game, the player who was chosen to take the first game turn (as per Section III.B) has initiative in the Deployment Phase.
Important Note on Battle Phase Determining Next Turn's Deployment Initiative
The Battle Phase determines initiative for the next turn's Deployment Phase. The player who performed the fewest Initiative Actions (specifically, declaring attacks, resolving mandatory Interrupts, and choosing to resolve optional Interrupts) in the Battle Phase has the initiative in the next Deployment Phase. Tiebreakers follow the standard procedure outlined above (fewest CP spent on those Initiative Actions, then the second tiebreaker rule).
It's important to note: While the Glossary (Section VIII) lists all possible 'Initiative Actions,' the rules for determining initiative for a specific phase (Deployment, Command, or Battle) will always clearly state which of these actions, and from which preceding phase or period, are to be counted. Always refer to the detailed rules in Section III.C for the precise criteria for each phase's initiative.

### Initiative Action Summary Table

The rules for determining initiative are detailed throughout Section III.C and III.D. To provide a quick overview, the following table summarizes which specific 'Initiative Actions' (defined in the Glossary, Section VIII) are counted, from which phase these actions are assessed, and for which upcoming phase or turn they determine initiative:

| Initiative For:                  | Determined by Actions in:         | Specific Initiative Actions Counted (from Glossary - Section VIII):                                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command Phase (current turn)     | Current Turn's Deployment Phase | - Deploying any card (Unit, Asset, Terrain, Upgrade).                                              |
| Battle Phase (current turn)      | Current Turn's Command Phase    | - Activating an Active Ability. <br> - Playing an Event card.                                          |
| Deployment Phase (next turn)     | Current Turn's Battle Phase     | - Declaring an attack. <br> - Resolving a mandatory Interrupt. <br> - Choosing to resolve an optional Interrupt. |

Please refer to the detailed descriptions in Section III.C (for phase-specific actions) and Section III.D (for full tiebreaker rules) for complete information on initiative.

### Example of Play

(This example illustrates a two-player game between Player A and Player B. Assume Player A won the initial flip and chose to go first.)
Initial Game Setup :
- Both players separate their Mission Cards and place them in their Mission Card Areas. Player A's Mission Cards give a base of 15 CP for turn calculations. Player B's Mission Cards give a base of 16 CP for turn calculations.
- Both players shuffle their main decks (without Mission Cards).
- They flip the top card of their main decks. Player A flips a 3 CP card. Player B flips a 5 CP card.
- Player A has the lower CP and chooses to go first.
- Both players shuffle the revealed cards back into their main decks.
Turn 1: Player A
- Ready Phase (Simultaneous) :
    - Both players deactivate any (none yet) exhausted cards.
    - Both players draw cards from their main decks until they have 5 cards in hand.
    - CP is reset and calculated (Player A: 15 CP, Player B: 16 CP, based on their Mission Cards and no other current bonuses).
    - No "start of Ready Phase" effects trigger yet. Player A (first player) would resolve any triggered effects first. None. Then Player B. None.
- Deployment Phase (Alternating, Player A has initiative) :
    - Player A (15 CP): Deploys "Scout Drone" (3 CP) to their Front Center. (Remaining CP: 12) (1 Initiative Action: deployment)
    - Player B (16 CP): Deploys "Guard Bot" (4 CP) to their Front Center. (Remaining CP: 12) (1 Initiative Action: deployment)
    - Player A (12 CP): Deploys "Tech Bunker" (Terrain, 5 CP) to their Back Center. (Remaining CP: 7) (1 Initiative Action: deployment, total 2 for Player A this phase)
    - Player B (12 CP): Passes.
    - Player A (7 CP): Passes.
    - Both players passed consecutively. Phase ends.
    - Initiative for Command Phase: Player A performed 2 Initiative Actions (deployments). Player B performed 1 Initiative Action (deployment). Player B performed fewer Initiative Actions and gains initiative for the Command Phase.
- Command Phase (Alternating, Player B has initiative) :
    - Player B (12 CP): Activates Guard Bot's ability "Shield Ally" (Cost 2 CP, Exhaust Guard Bot) targeting their Guard Bot. (Remaining CP: 10). Guard Bot is now exhausted. (1 Initiative Action: activating Active Ability)
    - Player A (7 CP): Plays Event card "Targeting Scramble" (3 CP). Effect resolves. Card goes to Discard. (Remaining CP: 4) (1 Initiative Action: playing Event card)
    - Player B (10 CP): Passes.
    - Player A (4 CP): Passes.
    - Both players passed consecutively. Phase ends.
    - Initiative for Battle Phase: Player B performed 1 Initiative Action. Player A performed 1 Initiative Action. Tie on number of Initiative Actions (1 each).
    - CP spent on those Initiative Actions: Player B spent 2 CP. Player A spent 3 CP. Player B spent fewer CP and gains initiative for the Battle Phase.
- Battle Phase (Alternating, Player B has initiative) :
    - Player B: Guard Bot is exhausted, cannot attack. Passes. (0 Initiative Actions: no attacks declared, no interrupts resolved)
    - Player A: Scout Drone (Attack 2) declares an attack on Player B's Guard Bot (Defense 3, currently shielded adding +1 Defense, so effectively 4). Scout Drone becomes exhausted. (1 Initiative Action: declaring an attack)
    - Combat: Scout Drone (A:2) vs Guard Bot (D:4). A<D. Scout Drone is destroyed and goes to Player A's Discard Pile. Guard Bot survives.
    - Player B: Passes.
    - Player A: Passes.
    - Both players passed consecutively. Phase ends.
    - Initiative for next turn's Deployment Phase: Player B performed 0 Initiative Actions (in Battle Phase). Player A performed 1 Initiative Action (in Battle Phase). Player B performed fewer Initiative Actions and gains initiative for the Deployment Phase of Turn 2.
Turn 2: Player B
- Ready Phase (Simultaneous) :
    - Player A deactivates no cards (Scout Drone was destroyed). Player B deactivates Guard Bot.
    - Both players draw up to 5 cards.
    - CP reset and calculated (Player A: 15 CP, Player B: 16 CP).
    - Any "start of Ready Phase" effects trigger. Resolve them starting with Player B (who has Deployment initiative for this turn), then Player A. (Play would continue following this structure.)

### Key Points and Observations from Example

- Initiative : Notice how initiative for the first turn is determined by the card flip (after Mission Cards are removed and before the final reshuffle). Initiative for subsequent phases and turns shifts based on Initiative Actions taken in the previous relevant phase, following the tiebreaker rules (fewest Initiative Actions, then fewest CP spent, then the second tiebreaker rule).
- Card Interactions : Observe the interplay between unit attacks, asset abilities, and event cards.
- Strategic Decisions : Consider how each player's choices reflect their deck's focus and overall strategy.

# IV. Card Types

Quantum Nexus boasts a diverse range of card types, each playing a unique role in shaping your strategy and determining the course of battles. Understanding the functions and characteristics of these card types is crucial for mastering the game.

## A. Units

Units are the backbone of your forces in Quantum Nexus. They engage in combat, defend your territory, and complete mission objectives. These cards have both Attack and Defense values, determining their offensive and defensive capabilities in battles. Units are always deployed into and remain within the controlling player's own quadrants on their side of the Battlefield. A player's units never enter an opponent's quadrants or play area.
- Attack Value : This number, located on the left side of the card, indicates how much damage a unit inflicts when attacking.
- Defense Value : This number, located on the right side of the card, represents how much damage a unit can withstand before being destroyed.
- Deployment Phase : Units are deployed onto the battlefield during the Deployment Phase, strategically positioning them within the player's own quadrants for future attacks and defense.
- Attack Range : Each unit has an attack range (Close, Mid, or Far) that dictates the pool of valid targets it can choose from, which may include quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield or on the attacking player's own side, relative to its current position within its own quadrants. (See Glossary, Section VIII).
- Leaders : Some units are designated as Leaders, possessing enhanced abilities and stats. Only one of a player's Leaders can occupy one of their quadrants at a time; no other Leader controlled by that same player may be moved or deployed into a quadrant that already contains one of their Leaders.
Units may become Leaders, or existing Leaders might have their state altered, through card-specific abilities or effects found in the rule box of cards such as Events, Upgrades, or as part of other card abilities. These are sometimes generally referred to as 'transformation' effects. The specific rules, conditions, and outcomes of such transformations are detailed on the individual cards that enable them. Unless a card's text explicitly overrides general game rules, all standard Leader limitations (e.g., the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule) and the procedures for resolving simultaneous Leader entries into a single quadrant apply when a unit becomes or changes into a Leader due to such a card effect. For instance, if an effect attempts to transform a unit into a Leader in a quadrant already occupied by another of that player's Leaders, and the transforming card does not provide a specific exception, the transformation would fail for that unit in that quadrant according to the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule.
- Resolving Simultaneous Leader Entries : If multiple game effects attempt to simultaneously cause more than one of a single player's Leader units to enter or exist in the same quadrant (through deployment, movement, or transformation), the following occurs: The active player determines the order in which these simultaneous effects attempt to resolve.
    - For each effect in sequence: If resolving it would result in more than one of that player's Leaders being in the target quadrant, that specific effect fails, and the Leader is not deployed, moved, or transformed.
    - If an effect successfully places a Leader, and this now means a subsequent simultaneous effect (if it were to resolve) would cause a violation, that subsequent effect will fail when its turn comes to be considered.
    - In essence, once a Leader successfully occupies a quadrant, no other Leader controlled by the same player can enter that quadrant as part of the same batch of simultaneous effects, even if another effect in that batch would subsequently move the first Leader out. The 'one Leader per quadrant' rule is checked at the point each individual simultaneous effect attempts to resolve. (Deck construction limits for Leaders are in Section II and Section VII.D).

## B. Assets

Assets are persistent cards that remain in the controlling player's Loadout Area throughout the game, providing ongoing benefits or activating special abilities. They differ from Units in that they have a Defense value but no Attack value. Assets inherently cannot declare an Attack (Action), as this action is exclusive to Units (see Glossary - Attack (Action)). If an Upgrade or other card effect grants an Attack value to an Asset, this Attack value may be referenced by other card abilities or effects (e.g., 'Destroy an Asset with an Attack value of X or more'), but it does not grant the Asset the ability to perform an Attack (Action) itself. Assets primarily influence the game through their printed abilities and persistent effects from the Loadout Area, not through direct combat participation as attackers.
- Defense Value : Similar to Units, Assets have a Defense value that determines how much damage they can withstand.
- Loadout Area : Unlike Units, Assets are not deployed onto the battlefield but are instead placed in the controlling player's Loadout Area. This protects them from direct attacks by enemy units.
- Activation : Asset abilities can be activated during the Command Phase, granting various effects such as boosting friendly units, hindering opponents, or manipulating the battlefield.
- Persistent Effects : Some Assets provide continuous passive effects that influence the game state for as long as they remain in play.

## C. Events

Event cards are powerful tools that can significantly impact the course of a game. These cards are played during the Command Phase and offer one-time effects before being discarded to the owner's Discard Pile.
- One-Time Use : Unlike Units and Assets, Events are not persistent and are discarded immediately after their effect resolves.
- Powerful Effects : Events can range from dealing direct damage to units, manipulating card positions, or granting temporary bonuses. Their strategic use can turn the tide of battle.

## D. Upgrades

Upgrades are cards that modify other cards on the battlefield, enhancing their abilities or granting them new ones. These cards typically attach to a player's own Units or Assets and remain in play as long as the modified card does.
- Modifying Attack and Defense : Upgrades can increase or decrease the Attack and Defense values of the attached card, making them stronger or weaker in combat.
- Additional Effects : Many Upgrades grant additional abilities or effects to the attached card, expanding its tactical potential.

## E. Terrain

Terrain cards represent different environments on the battlefield and affect the units within specific quadrants. These cards are deployed during the Deployment Phase into a player's own quadrants on their side of the Battlefield and remain in play until removed by a card effect. A player may only deploy Terrain cards into any of the quadrants on their own side of the Battlefield.
- Quadrant Effects : Each Terrain card applies a passive effect to all units (friendly or enemy, if an enemy unit is targeting into or being affected within that quadrant from afar, as units never co-occupy opponent's quadrants) located in the specific quadrant on the owning player's side of the Battlefield where the Terrain is active. These effects can range from stat bonuses to special abilities or restrictions.
- Limited Placement : A player can have a maximum of two of their own Terrain cards active in any single one of their quadrants at any given time. For example, Player A can have up to two Terrain cards in their Front Left quadrant; this does not affect how many Terrain cards Player B can have in Player B's Front Left quadrant.
- Stacking Terrain Effects : If two Terrain cards are active in the same quadrant, their effects are cumulative unless specified otherwise on the cards. If Terrain effects provide numerical modifiers (e.g., one grants "+1 Attack" and another grants "-1 Attack" to the same units), these numerical modifiers are combined (e.g., +1 and -1 result in a net +0). If a non-numerical effect from a Terrain card active in a quadrant explicitly negates, prevents, or forbids an action, state, or condition that another non-numerical effect active in or targeting that same quadrant (whether from another Terrain card, a Unit ability, an Event card, or any other game source) explicitly permits, enables, or creates, and the rules do not specify a hierarchy (e.g., 'card effects override game rules'), then neither of those specific, directly conflicting effects is applied. Other, non-conflicting effects from the involved cards still apply. (Example: If Terrain A says 'Units in this quadrant cannot use Activated Abilities' and an Event effect says 'Target unit may use an additional Activated Ability this turn even if it normally couldn't,' these are directly opposing regarding that unit's ability to use an Activated Ability in that quadrant due to Terrain A). Card-specific rulings or the official FAQ should be consulted if the nature of a conflict remains unclear.

# V. Areas of Play

Quantum Nexus utilizes several distinct areas where cards are played and interacted with. Understanding these areas and their functions is essential for smooth gameplay and strategic decision-making.

## A. Mission Card Area

Located prominently above the playing area, the Mission Card Area is where players place their chosen mission cards face-up at the beginning of the game from their own deck. This area serves two primary purposes:
- Visibility : By placing mission cards face-up, all players can easily see each other's objectives. This transparency ensures fairness and allows players to strategize accordingly.
- Reference : Throughout the game, players can refer to their mission cards to track their progress and plan their actions. Completing mission objectives is a key victory condition in Quantum Nexus.

## B. Deck

The Deck is the heart of each player's arsenal, containing their carefully constructed collection of cards (excluding Mission Cards after initial setup).
- Starting Point : At the beginning of the game, after Mission Cards are removed and after the initiative flip and subsequent reshuffle, each player's main deck is placed face-down in their designated Deck area.
- Drawing Cards : During their turn, players draw cards from their own deck to replenish their hand and gain access to new options.
- Deck Depletion : If a player is unable to draw a card when required, they lose the game. This emphasizes the importance of managing your deck and resources effectively.

## C. Discard Pile

The Discard Pile serves as a repository for cards that are no longer in play from that player's hand, deck, or their side of the battlefield/loadout area.
- Discarding Cards : Cards are sent to their owner's Discard Pile when they are destroyed in battle, used for their effects, or discarded due to other game mechanics.
- Face-Up Placement : Discarded cards are placed face-up in the owner's Discard Pile, allowing all players to see which cards have been used or eliminated.

## D. Loadout Area

The Loadout Area is a designated space for each player's Asset cards.
- Asset Placement : When Asset cards are played from a player's hand, they are not placed on the battlefield like Units. Instead, they are placed face-up in the owner's Loadout Area.
- Protection : Assets in the Loadout Area are immune to direct attacks from enemy units, offering a degree of protection. However, they can still be targeted by certain card abilities or effects.
- Ongoing Effects : Assets typically provide continuous benefits or activate powerful abilities, making them valuable strategic assets.

## E. Battlefield

The Battlefield is the central arena where Units are deployed and battles unfold. It is divided into distinct zones for each player.
- Quadrants : The Battlefield for each player consists of six quadrants: Front Left, Front Center, Front Right (collectively the 'Front Row' of quadrants), and Back Left, Back Center, Back Right (collectively the 'Back Row' of quadrants). These quadrants dictate unit positioning within a player's own area and their potential attack ranges against opponents or even their own units. For precise definitions of directional terms used to describe movement and targeting on the battlefield, refer to the 'Directional Terms on the Battlefield' section in the Glossary (Section VIII).
- Front Row and Back Row : The terms 'Front Row' and 'Back Row' refer to these collective sets of quadrants. The Front-Row Priority rule (see Section III.C.4) is critical for targeting opponent's units.
- Flanks and Center : The Battlefield is also considered in terms of columns (Left, Center, Right) often referred to as flanks (Left, Right) and Center. These offer strategic options for unit placement and movement within a player's own side.
- Attack Range : Each Unit card has a designated attack range (Close, Mid, or Far) that determines the pool of valid targets from which it can choose a defender. This pool may include quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield or, in some cases, quadrants on the attacking player's own side, depending on the unit's current position within its owner's quadrants. (See Glossary, Section VIII).

## F. Player Areas and Card Control

Each player controls their own set of Battlefield quadrants (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Back Left, Back Center, Back Right), their Mission Card Area, their Deck, their Discard Pile, and their Loadout Area. Unless a card effect or game rule specifically states otherwise, players may only deploy, move, or place their cards and effects into their own areas of play. A player's cards will never leave their own play area (Battlefield quadrants, Loadout Area, Discard Pile, Deck, Hand, Mission Card Area) to enter an opponent's play area. Players may not physically move, touch, or otherwise manipulate cards or components within an opponent's designated play areas, except when an opponent's card is destroyed as a result of gameplay and is then moved by its owner to their own Discard Pile. This rule is absolute: Never will a player touch another player's card for any other reason. No card effect will ever break this rule; it is forbidden by design. Any card effect that results in an opponent's card changing zones, being modified, or otherwise affected must be physically carried out by the card's owner, even if the decision or targeting is made by the player activating the effect.

# VI. Winning the Game

In Quantum Nexus, victory can be achieved through two distinct paths, each requiring different strategic approaches and tactical execution.

## A. Emptying Opponent's Deck

The first and most direct path to victory is to force an opponent to draw a card when their deck is empty. If a player is unable to draw a card when required, they immediately lose the game and are eliminated. This applies even if multiple players are forced to draw simultaneously and cannot. There are no draw conditions related to deck out; players are individually eliminated until only one winner remains or all players have been eliminated. If all players are eliminated, there is no winner. This can be accomplished through various means, such as:
- Aggressive Attacks : Continuously attacking and destroying an opponent's units will gradually deplete their deck. By focusing on offensive strategies and overpowering their defenses, you can push them closer to defeat.
- Discard Effects : Some cards possess abilities that force opponents to discard cards from their deck. Utilizing these effects strategically can accelerate their deck depletion and bring you closer to victory.
- Deck Manipulation : Certain cards and abilities allow you to manipulate an opponent's deck, potentially burying key cards or disrupting their strategy. This indirect approach can weaken their options and increase the likelihood of them running out of cards.

## B. Completing Mission Cards

The second path to victory involves completing all of your mission cards. Each mission card presents specific objectives that, when fulfilled, grant you victory points and potentially powerful rewards. If a player completes all of their mission cards, they immediately win the game. If multiple players simultaneously meet the conditions for completing all of their respective mission cards (e.g., as a result of the same triggered effect or chain of effects resolving), all such players are declared winners. The game concludes, and all these players share the victory.
- Diverse Objectives : Mission cards encompass a variety of objectives, ranging from controlling specific quadrants on the battlefield to deploying certain unit types or achieving specific combat feats.
- Passive Effects : Many mission cards provide passive effects that benefit your forces or hinder your opponent upon completion. These effects can significantly impact the game's momentum.
- Powerful Abilities : Some mission cards grant powerful one-time abilities upon completion, such as dealing massive damage, drawing additional cards, or manipulating the battlefield.
- Strategic Planning : To achieve victory through mission completion, careful planning is essential. You must prioritize which missions to pursue and tailor your strategy accordingly. By understanding these two paths to victory, you can adapt your approach based on the composition of your deck, your opponent's strategy, and the evolving game state. Whether you choose to focus on aggressive deck depletion or methodical mission completion, Quantum Nexus offers a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

# VII. Additional Rules and Clarifications

## A. Card Interactions

Quantum Nexus features a dynamic interplay between different card types and abilities. Understanding how cards interact is crucial for making informed decisions and maximizing your strategic potential.
- Targeting : "Targeting" refers to how a card's range or ability defines a pool of valid targets. Some card abilities allow you to target specific card types, subtypes, or locations on an opponent's battlefield, or specific cards they control, or even your own cards or quadrants. Pay close attention to the wording of each ability and range definition to determine its valid targets. An "attack" then involves selecting one specific, valid target from this pool to be the defender.
- Triggered Abilities : Many cards possess triggered abilities that activate in response to specific events, such as deploying a unit, attacking, or being attacked. These abilities can create powerful chain reactions and turn the tide of battle.
- Mandatory and Optional Interrupts : Some abilities are mandatory interrupts, meaning they must be activated if their trigger condition is met. Others are optional interrupts, giving you the choice to activate them by paying a specified cost. The act of resolving a mandatory interrupt, or choosing to activate and pay costs for an optional interrupt, is considered "activating" the card for purposes like initiative determination (see Initiative Action in Glossary, Section VIII).
- Stacking Effects : Multiple card effects can interact and stack with each other. Understanding the order in which effects resolve and how they modify each other is essential for accurate gameplay.
- Resolution Order for Triggered Abilities and Effects : When an action or event causes multiple card abilities or effects to trigger simultaneously, they resolve using the following layered process:
    - Initial Triggers (First Layer)
        1. Active Player Resolves First: The currently active player (the player whose turn it is to act within an alternating phase, or the player with priority to resolve effects in a simultaneous phase) first gathers all of their own abilities and effects that have triggered from that specific action/event.
        2. The active player then chooses the order in which these effects will resolve and resolves all of them completely.
        3. Other Players Resolve (Clockwise): After the active player has resolved all their triggered abilities and effects, the next player in turn order (clockwise) gathers all of their own abilities and effects that triggered from the same initial action or event.
        4. That player chooses the order for their effects and resolves all of them completely.
        5. This process (steps 3-4) continues clockwise until all players have resolved their abilities and effects that were triggered by the initial action or event.
    - Newly Triggered Effects (Subsequent Layers)
        6. Identify New Triggers: If resolving any effects in the current layer (e.g., Layer 1) causes new abilities or effects to trigger, these new triggers are momentarily set aside. They will form the next layer of effects to be resolved.
        7. Complete Current Layer First: The next layer of triggers is addressed only after all effects from the current layer have finished resolving for all players.
        8. Resolve Next Layer: Once the current layer is complete, address the set-aside new triggers as follows:
            a. For each effect in the previous layer that caused one or more new triggers, the player who controlled that causing effect becomes the 'priority player' for the specific triggers it generated.
            b. The 'priority player' gathers all abilities they control that were triggered by their specific causing effect, chooses the order for them to resolve, and resolves all of them completely.
            c. Then, proceeding clockwise from the 'priority player,' any other players resolve any of their abilities that were triggered by that same specific causing effect, in an order of their choosing for their own effects.
            d. If multiple different effects in the previous layer caused distinct sets of new triggers, repeat steps 8a-8c for each set. The order in which these sets are addressed generally follows the order in which their causing effects resolved in the previous layer.
        9. Repeat Process: This process of resolving a layer, identifying new triggers, and then resolving the subsequent layer continues until a layer resolves completely with no new abilities triggering.

Example of Layered Trigger Resolution:
Consider this scenario: Player A plays an Event card, 'Quantum Shockwave.' This Event's effect has two immediate consequences: it triggers an ability on Player A's 'Guardian Bot' Unit and also triggers an ability on Player B's 'Energy Siphon' Asset. When 'Guardian Bot's' ability resolves, it further triggers a 'Retaliate' ability on Player A's 'Sentinel Drone' and an 'Overload' ability on Player B's 'Defense Grid' Terrain. Assume Player A is the active player.

Visualizing the Chain:
graph TD
    A[Initial Action: P.A plays Event 'Quantum Shockwave'] --> B{Layer 1 Triggers};

        F --> G[P.A Sentinel Drone: 'Retaliate'];
        F --> H[P.B Defense Grid: 'Overload'];
        D -- P.B resolves 2nd --> I[Resolution of 'Absorb_Pulse' (no new triggers)];
    end

    subgraph Layer 2 Resolution (Caused by 'Protect_Mode_Engaged')
        direction LR
        note_G[Player A controlled 'Protect_Mode_Engaged', thus has priority for its consequences.]
        G -- P.A resolves 1st --> J[Resolution of 'Retaliate'];
        H -- P.B resolves 2nd --> K[Resolution of 'Overload'];
    end
    J --> L[All Effects Resolved];
    K --> L;

Explanation of the Chain:
1. Initial Action: Player A plays 'Quantum Shockwave'.
2. Layer 1 Triggers Identified:
    - Player A's 'Guardian Bot' ability ('Protect_Mode_Engaged').
    - Player B's 'Energy Siphon' ability ('Absorb_Pulse').
3. Layer 1 Resolution:
    - Player A (active player) chooses to resolve their 'Guardian Bot' ability first. This ability's resolution causes two new triggers: Player A's 'Sentinel Drone' ('Retaliate') and Player B's 'Defense Grid' ('Overload'). These new triggers are set aside for Layer 2.
    - Next, Player B resolves their 'Energy Siphon' ability. (Assume for this example it causes no new triggers).
4. Layer 1 Complete. Layer 2 Triggers Identified:
    - Player A's 'Sentinel Drone' ('Retaliate') – caused by P.A's 'Guardian Bot' effect.
    - Player B's 'Defense Grid' ('Overload') – caused by P.A's 'Guardian Bot' effect.
5. Layer 2 Resolution:
    - Player A controlled the 'Guardian Bot' ability ('Protect_Mode_Engaged') that caused these Layer 2 triggers. Thus, Player A is the 'priority player' for these specific consequences. Player A resolves their 'Sentinel Drone' ability.
    - Player B then resolves their 'Defense Grid' ability (as it was also triggered by Player A's 'Guardian Bot' effect).
6. Layer 2 Complete. No new triggers. All effects from this chain have resolved.

- Invalid Targets or Conditions Upon Resolution : If all mandatory targets for a triggered ability or effect are no longer legal or valid when that ability or effect resolves (due to other effects that resolved earlier, for example), the ability or effect fails to resolve and does nothing (it "fizzles"). If an effect has multiple targets or actions, and only some become invalid, the effect resolves as much as possible for the remaining valid targets or actions.

## B. Changing the Order of Play (Initiative Summary)

While the phases of a turn follow a set sequence, the concept of initiative (detailed in Section III.D and specific phase descriptions) determines who acts first within alternating-turn phases.
- Simultaneous Actions : In some phases, like the Ready Phase's core actions, players act simultaneously.
- Passing Turns : Players can pass their turn during the Deployment, Command, and Battle Phases if they have no more actions they wish to take.
- Gaining Initiative : If all players pass consecutively in an alternating-turn phase, that phase ends. Initiative for the next applicable phase (or the next turn's Deployment phase) is determined by the rules in Section III.D: fewest relevant Initiative Actions (as specified for each phase in Section III.C), then fewest CP spent on those Initiative Actions, then the specific second tiebreaker rule. This prevents stalemates and keeps the game flowing.

## C. Ending the Game

A game of Quantum Nexus concludes when one of the victory conditions is met:
- Deck Depletion : If a player is unable to draw a card when required, their deck is considered empty, and they lose the game (or are eliminated in a multiplayer game, with all such players suffering a loss if simultaneous).
- Mission Completion : If a player completes all of their mission cards, they immediately win the game, regardless of the state of their opponent's deck or other players.

## D. Card Type Counts (Leader Limit)

Aside from the limit imposed per card by the Duplicates attribute or from the 200 CP limit of the deck, there is one other restriction on the types of cards a player must have in their deck: Each deck can't have any more then 25 CP worth of Leader Unit cards. This 25 CP is part of the overall 200 CP limit for the main deck. Each card type has very specific strengths and weaknesses that can only be balanced with a thought-out and diverse army.

# VIII. Glossary of Terms

To help you fully grasp the intricacies of Quantum Nexus, here is a glossary of essential terms used throughout the game:

### Directional Terms on the Battlefield

When rules, card effects, or range definitions refer to directions on the battlefield, the following definitions apply. These directions are generally determined from the perspective of the active player controlling the unit or effect in question, and relative to the structure of the battlefield (quadrants, rows, and the opponent's side).
- Forward:
    - Within a Player's Own Side: The direction from a unit's current quadrant in their Back Row towards the quadrant in the same column in their own Front Row.
    - Towards an Opponent's Side: The direction from a unit's current quadrant (typically in the active player's Front Row) towards the corresponding quadrant (same column) in a declared opponent's Front Row.
    - General Principle: "Forward" always indicates movement or orientation away from the active player's board edge and towards an opponent's side, or from a player's Back Row towards their Front Row.
    - Multiplayer Context: In multiplayer games, "Forward" is always oriented towards the specific opponent who has been declared as the target for the current action or effect. This aligns with the rule (Section III.C.4) that a player's Front Row is considered to be facing the declared opponent's Front Row for targeting purposes.
- Backward:
    - Within a Player's Own Side: The direction from a unit's current quadrant in their Front Row towards the quadrant in the same column in their own Back Row.
    - General Principle: "Backward" always indicates movement or orientation away from the opponent's side and towards the active player's own board edge, or from a player's Front Row towards their Back Row.
    - A unit cannot target, move, or have its position referenced "Backward" off the playable area of its controller's side of the battlefield.
- Left:
    - The direction from a unit's current quadrant to an existing, horizontally adjacent quadrant towards the active player's left-hand side, typically within the same row (Front or Back Row).
- Right:
    - The direction from a unit's current quadrant to an existing, horizontally adjacent quadrant towards the active player's right-hand side, typically within the same row (Front or Back Row).
- Diagonal Directions:
    - These are compound directions derived from the cardinal directions. For example:
        - Forward-Left: The quadrant that is one step Forward and one step Left from the point of origin.
        - Backward-Right: The quadrant that is one step Backward and one step Right from the point of origin.
    - All component directions of a diagonal movement or reference must correspond to existing quadrants on the battlefield to be valid.

- Activate : To use a card's ability or effect. Activation often involves paying costs (like CP). For Active Abilities, it also typically requires the card to be in a ready state and may cause it to become exhausted. Declaring an attack is also a form of activation. Resolving a mandatory interrupt, or choosing to activate and pay costs for an optional interrupt, is also considered activating the card/ability. For specific actions that count towards determining initiative, see Initiative Action.
- Active Ability : An ability identified in a card's rule box that a player must consciously choose to use. Unless a card specifically states its Active Ability can be used during other phases, Active Abilities may only be activated during the Command Phase. Activating it usually requires paying costs (like CP) and often requires exhausting the card (turning it sideways). This is an Initiative Action.
- Asset : A card type that can be deployed into the controlling player's loadout area and grants effects from outside of that player's direct battlefield quadrants. Deploying an Asset is an Initiative Action.
- Attack (Action) : The act of choosing one of your units to be an attacker and selecting a valid target (friendly or opposing unit) as the defender, then resolving combat based on Attack and Defense values. Declaring an attack is an Initiative Action.
- Attack Value : This number represents the unit's offensive strength. When comparing an attacking unit's Attack Value (A) to the defending unit's Defense Value (D) during combat (whether the defender is friendly or opposing):
    - If A>D: The defending unit is destroyed. The attacking unit survives.
    - If A<D: The attacking unit is destroyed. The defending unit survives.
    - If A=D: Neither unit is destroyed; both remain on the battlefield.
- Battlefield : The central playing area where units are deployed and battles take place, consisting of each player's six quadrants. A player's cards always remain on their side of the battlefield or in their designated play areas.
- Close Range : A unit with a Close Range attack or ability can target its own current quadrant AND one existing quadrant directly Forward, Backward, Left, and Right of its current quadrant. This results in targeting up to 5 quadrants. If a quadrant in one of these relative positions does not exist (e.g., off the edge of the board), it cannot be targeted. A unit declaring an attack with Close Range may target its own unit in its own quadrant (i.e., attack itself), provided it is a valid target according to all other attack rules.
- Command Phase : The phase in which players activate abilities and play Event cards.
- Command Points (CP) : A resource used to deploy units and activate abilities. Each card has a CP cost, and players have a limited amount of CP each turn.
- Deactivate : The action of returning an exhausted card to its ready (upright) state, typically performed during the Ready Phase. This allows the card to potentially perform actions requiring it to be ready later in the turn.
- Deck : A player's collection of cards (excluding Mission Cards after initial setup), from which they draw during their turn.
- Defense Value : This number represents the unit's resilience in combat. When comparing an attacking unit's Attack Value (A) to the defending unit's Defense Value (D) (whether the defender is friendly or opposing):
    - If D>A (or A<D): The defending unit survives the combat. The attacking unit is destroyed.
    - If A=D (or D=A): Neither unit is destroyed; both remain on the battlefield.
    - If D<A (or A>D): The defending unit is destroyed. The attacking unit survives.
- Deployment Phase : The phase in which players alternately deploy units and terrain cards onto their own side of the battlefield. Deploying a card is an Initiative Action.
- Discard Pile : A pile where a player's destroyed or used cards are placed.
- Domain : A thematic category associated with mission cards and unit cards (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity).
- Event : A card type that provides a powerful one-time effect when played during the Command Phase. Playing an Event card is an Initiative Action.
- Exhaust : To turn a card sideways from its ready (upright) position. This is often required as part of the cost or process for a unit to declare an attack or for a card to use an Active Ability. An exhausted card cannot normally be exhausted again or perform other actions requiring it to be ready until it is deactivated.
- Far Range : An attack range allowing a unit to target all quadrants located exactly two rows ahead of its current row, on an opponent's side of the battlefield. This range defines the pool of valid targets. Units in a player's Front Row target all quadrants in the opponent's Back Row. Units in a player's Back Row target all quadrants in the opponent's Front Row. Far Range does not include the attacking unit's own current quadrant as part of its targetable area.
- Flank : The left and right columns of quadrants on a player's side of the battlefield.
- Friendly Unit : A unit controlled by the same player who controls the unit that is attacking or using an ability.
- Front Row : The row of three quadrants (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right) on a player's side of the battlefield closest to the opposing side(s).
- Initiative : The process that determines which player acts first within certain phases (Deployment, Command, Battle) or for the first turn of the game (see Section III.B). For phase initiative, it is generally awarded to the player who performed the fewest Initiative Actions (as specified for each phase in Section III.C) in a specific previous phase. Tiebreakers are: 1) fewest CP spent on those exact Initiative Actions, then 2) the specific condition outlined in Section III.D's second tiebreaker (based on who was next to act before consecutive passes or who held initiative). For detailed rules on initiative determination, see Section III.D.
- Initiative Action : For the purposes of determining phase initiative, an 'Initiative Action' is defined as any of the following distinct instances:
    - Deploying a card (Unit, Asset, Terrain, Upgrade).
    - Activating an Active Ability on a card.
    - Playing an Event card.
    - Declaring an attack with a unit.
    - Resolving a mandatory Interrupt.
    - Choosing to resolve an optional Interrupt (and paying its costs, if any). Each distinct instance of these actions counts as one Initiative Action. The specific subset of these actions that are counted for a particular phase's initiative is defined in Section III.C for that phase.
- Interrupt : A card ability that triggers in response to a specific event, either mandatory or optional. Resolving a mandatory Interrupt or choosing to resolve an optional Interrupt is an Initiative Action.
- Leader : A powerful unit card. A player is limited to one of their Leaders per one of their quadrants. Deck construction limits for Leaders are in Section II and Section VII.D. (See Section IV.A for rules on how card-specific 'transformation' effects interact with Leader limits). Deploying a Leader is an Initiative Action.
- Loadout Area : A designated area for each player to place their Asset cards.
- Mid Range : A unit with a Mid Range attack or ability can target one existing quadrant directly Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Forward-Left Diagonal, Forward-Right Diagonal, Backward-Left Diagonal, and Backward-Right Diagonal from its current quadrant. Mid Range does not include the attacking unit's own current quadrant as part of its targetable area. This results in targeting up to 8 surrounding quadrants. If a quadrant in one of these relative positions does not exist (e.g., off the edge of the board), it cannot be targeted. Diagrams are recommended for understanding range.
- Mission Card : A card representing an objective, providing passive effects or abilities upon completion. These are kept in the player's Mission Card Area.
- Opposing Unit : A unit controlled by an opponent.
- Passive Ability : An ability that is always active and does not require activation.
- Quadrant : One of the six sections of a player's side of the battlefield (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Back Left, Back Center, Back Right). A player's cards can only occupy their own quadrants.
- Ready Phase : The phase in which players deactivate cards, draw new cards, and reset/calculate their CP.
- Ready : The normal, upright orientation of a card in play, indicating it is prepared to perform actions that may require it to become exhausted (e.g., attacking or using certain abilities). Cards start in the ready state when deployed and return to it when deactivated.
- Rule Box : The section of a card that details its abilities, effects, and any special conditions.
- Subtype : A more specific classification of a card's type, such as its affiliation or special ability.
- Targeting : The process by which a card's range or ability defines a pool of valid targets (which can be quadrants or cards, friendly or opposing). An attack or ability must choose its specific target(s) from this pool.
- Terrain : A card type that modifies the battlefield, affecting units in specific quadrants on the owning player's side. Deploying Terrain is an Initiative Action.
- Triggered Ability : An ability that activates automatically when a specific condition is met.
- Unit : A card type representing characters or vehicles used for attacking and defending, deployed into the owner's quadrants. Deploying a Unit is an Initiative Action.
- Upgrade : A card type that modifies the abilities or stats of another of the owner's cards. Deploying an Upgrade is an Initiative Action.
- Note on Ranges : For precise definitions of directional terms such as 'Forward,' 'Backward,' 'Left,' and 'Right' used in range descriptions, please refer to the 'Directional Terms on the Battlefield' section at the beginning of this Glossary. Attack ranges define the pool of valid targets. Attacks are generally directed at opposing units, but specific ranges or card effects may allow targeting a player's own quadrants or units. If a player declares an attack against one of their own friendly units (a valid target), combat resolution is identical to attacking an opposing unit. Range definitions apply consistently across all game types, including multiplayer, as detailed in Section III.C.4.

# IX. Advanced Gameplay Concepts

As you become more familiar with Quantum Nexus, elevate your gameplay with these advanced strategies:

## A. Resource Management and Tempo

Command Points (CP) are your lifeblood. Mastering their use is key to victory. Prioritize which cards to deploy, abilities to activate, and when to unleash Event cards based on the game's flow and your strategic goals.
- Tempo : This refers to the pace at which you utilize your CP. A well-timed play can disrupt your opponent's plans, while overspending early on may leave you vulnerable later. Strive for a balance that maintains pressure while leaving resources for adapting to the unexpected.

## B. Card Advantage and Board Control

In Quantum Nexus, numbers matter. Card advantage, having more resources than your opponent, can be achieved through:
- Efficient Trades : Destroy enemy units while minimizing your own losses.
- Card Draw Effects : Utilize cards that let you draw additional cards, expanding your options.
- Disruption : Force your opponent to discard cards or waste resources. Controlling the battlefield (board control) goes hand-in-hand with card advantage. Strategic unit placement within your own quadrants, tactical retreats, and area denial tactics (affecting how an opponent can target your side) can limit your opponent's options and give you the upper hand.

## C. Adapting to Your Opponent

Every opponent brings a unique deck and strategy. Stay observant, analyze their choices, and adapt your tactics to counter their approach. Flexibility is key; don't be afraid to shift your game plan if your initial strategy falters.

## D. Psychological Warfare

Sometimes, the most potent weapon is your opponent's mind. Calculated bluffs, misdirection, and unexpected plays can create openings and sow doubt.

# XIII. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## A. Gameplay Questions

- Q: Can I deploy multiple units in the same quadrant?
- A: Yes, you can deploy multiple of your units in the same one of your quadrants, except for Leaders. Only one of your Leaders can occupy one of your quadrants at a time. (See Section IV.A for rules on Leader limits, and for how card-specific 'transformation' effects interact with these limits). A player's units never enter an opponent's quadrants.
- Q: Can I activate multiple abilities of the same card during the Command Phase?
- A: It depends on the card. Some cards allow multiple activations of the same ability, while others restrict it to once per turn or have specific conditions. Refer to the card's rule box.
- Q: What happens if a unit's Attack and Defense values are equal in battle?
- A: In case of a tie (A=D), neither unit is destroyed; both remain on the battlefield. This applies whether the defending unit is friendly or opposing. (See Section III.C.4 and the Glossary definitions for Attack Value and Defense Value).
- Q: Can I play Event cards during the Deployment Phase?
- A: No, Event cards can only be played during the Command Phase.
- Q: Can I target my own units with card abilities?
- A: Yes. "Targeting" defines a pool of valid targets based on a card's range or ability text. This pool can include your own units or quadrants if the range/ability allows. Some abilities specifically target your own units, while others can only target an opponent's units. Refer to the card's rule box and range definitions (Section VIII).
- Q: Can I attack my own units?
- A: Yes. If one of your own units (a "friendly unit") is a valid target for an attack (e.g., it is within the attacking unit's range, such as a unit attacking itself with Close Range, and meets any other criteria), you may declare an attack against it. Combat resolution (comparing Attack and Defense values) is identical to attacking an opponent's unit. (See Section III.C.4).

## B. Card Clarifications

- Q: How do I determine a unit's attack range?
- A: The unit's attack range is indicated on its card (Close, Mid, or Far) and defined in the Glossary (Section VIII). This range determines the pool of valid targets (quadrants or units within them, potentially friendly or opposing) from which the unit can choose a defender for an attack. Diagrams are recommended for full understanding, especially for Close and Mid Range. (See also Glossary - Note on Ranges).
- Q: What happens to an Upgrade attached to a unit that is destroyed?
- A: If the unit an Upgrade is attached to is destroyed, the Upgrade is also destroyed and sent to the owner's Discard Pile.
- Q: Can Terrain cards be destroyed?
- A: Yes, Terrain cards can be destroyed by card abilities or effects that specifically target them.
- Q: Can I complete multiple mission cards in the same turn?
- A: Yes, you can complete multiple mission cards in the same turn, as long as their conditions are met.

# XIV. Building Your First Deck

## A. Core Card Selection

Start by selecting core cards that represent the foundation of your deck. These cards should be versatile, efficient, and synergize well with each other. Consider a mix of unit cards for combat, asset cards for support, and event cards for tactical flexibility.

## B. Synergy and Theme

As you expand your deck, look for cards that complement your core cards and create powerful synergies. This could involve focusing on a specific domain, utilizing cards with shared keywords or abilities, or building around a particular strategy. A well-themed deck with strong synergies will be more consistent and effective than a random collection of cards.

## C. Testing and Refinement

Building a successful deck takes time and experimentation. Don't be afraid to test different card combinations, play against various opponents, and analyze your wins and losses. Learn from your experiences and adjust your deck accordingly. The more you play and refine your deck, the better you'll understand the intricacies of Quantum Nexus and develop your own unique playstyle.

## D. Seeking Advice

The Quantum Nexus community is a valuable resource for new players. Don't hesitate to seek advice from experienced players, browse online forums, and participate in community discussions.

Building your first deck is an exciting journey of discovery and self-expression. Embrace the creative process, experiment with different approaches, and most importantly, have fun exploring the vast possibilities that Quantum Nexus has to offer.

# XV. Tips and Strategies for New Players

Embarking on your Quantum Nexus journey can be both exciting and overwhelming. Here are some valuable tips and strategies to help you get started and improve your gameplay:

## A. Early Game Focus

In the early game, focus on establishing board presence within your quadrants and securing key positions for attacking or defending. Deploy units with strong early-game potential, such as those with low CP costs or abilities that benefit from early deployment. Aim to control the center of your battlefield area and protect your weaker units with stronger ones.

## B. Resource Management

Command Points (CP) are a precious resource, so use them wisely. Carefully consider which cards to deploy, which abilities to activate, and when to play event cards. Don't overextend yourself early on, as you'll need CP for later turns to respond to your opponent's moves.

## C. Card Advantage

Strive to gain card advantage by drawing more cards than your opponent or by forcing them to discard cards. Card draw effects, efficient trades (destroying opponent's units while preserving your own), and disrupting your opponent's strategy can all contribute to gaining card advantage.

## D. Adaptability

Quantum Nexus is a dynamic game, and your opponent's strategies will vary. Be prepared to adapt your game plan as needed. If your initial strategy isn't working, don't be afraid to switch tactics or focus on different objectives.

## E. Mind Games

Sometimes, the best strategy is to outsmart your opponent. Bluffing, misdirection, and unexpected plays can catch them off guard and create opportunities for you to gain an advantage.

## F. Learn from Experience

The best way to improve at Quantum Nexus is to play regularly and learn from your mistakes. Analyze your wins and losses, experiment with different decks and strategies, and seek advice from experienced players.

## G. Additional Tips

- Know Your Deck : Familiarize yourself with all the cards in your deck, their abilities, and their interactions. This will help you make informed decisions during gameplay.
- Watch Your Opponent : Pay attention to your opponent's plays and try to anticipate their next move. This will allow you to react effectively and counter their strategies.
- Have Fun : Quantum Nexus is a game meant to be enjoyed. Don't get discouraged by losses, and always remember to have fun while playing. By following these tips and strategies, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled Quantum Nexus player. Remember, practice, experimentation, and a willingness to learn are key to mastering this complex and rewarding game.

# XVI. Advanced Deck Building Strategies

Crafting a winning deck involves more than just throwing together powerful cards. Here's how to refine your deck-building prowess:

## A. Metagame Analysis and Tech Choices

Stay ahead of the curve by analyzing the current metagame—the popular decks and strategies in the Quantum Nexus community. Identify dominant trends and tailor your deck to counter them.
- Tech Choices : These are cards specifically included to address prevalent threats. They might not shine in every match, but they can be the difference-maker against certain decks.

## B. Curve Optimization

A well-balanced curve is crucial. It ensures you have plays available at every stage of the game, maximizing your CP efficiency. Aim for a smooth progression of card costs from low to high, allowing you to maintain pressure throughout the match.

## C. Sideboarding

This is the art of fine-tuning your deck between games in a match. By swapping out specific cards, you can adapt your strategy to better counter your current opponent's deck.

## D. Deck Archetypes

Quantum Nexus offers various deck archetypes, each with distinct playstyles:
- Aggro : Overwhelm opponents with early aggression.
- Control : Outlast opponents through disruption and resource denial.
- Combo : Execute powerful combinations for devastating effects.
- Midrange : Strike a balance between aggression and control. Experiment with different archetypes to find the one that suits your playstyle and the current metagame.
