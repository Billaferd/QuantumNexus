# **Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules**

## **Note to Players**

This rulebook is a comprehensive guide to playing Quantum Nexus, providing the foundational rules for the game. While this rulebook aims to be complete, Quantum Nexus is an evolving game. Quantum Nexus is made of many interconnected systems and it may take a while to learn it. There is a Quantum Nexus Quick Start Guide, to ease new players into the game with a limited rule set. When those are understood, we recommend moving on to this rule book for the full experience.

## **I. Introduction to Quantum Nexus**

### **A. Game Overview**

Quantum Nexus is an exhilarating sci-fi trading card game that transports players into a world of strategic battles between advanced civilizations. Players build decks of cards representing various units, leaders, and powerful events to outmaneuver their opponents. The game requires strategic thinking, tactical decision-making, and a deep understanding of card interactions to achieve victory. Quantum Nexus can be played by two or more players, with two being the most common configuration. In multiplayer games, players are typically arranged in a circle. A **Game Round** consists of a Start of Round step, followed by an **Activation Sequence** where players take single actions, or turns, in clockwise order until all pass.

The objective of Quantum Nexus is to establish total dominance over the front line, forcing your opponent into a retreat and securing victory.

### **B. Components**

To play Quantum Nexus, you will need the following components:

* **Cards:** These are the heart of the game, representing units, leaders, assets, events, upgrades, terrain, and missions. Each card has unique abilities and characteristics that contribute to your overall strategy.  
* **Mission Card Area:** This designated area is where you place your mission cards face-up at the beginning of the game.  
* **Deck:** This is where you keep your shuffled deck of cards, drawing from it during the Start of Round Step.  
* **Discard Area:** When cards are destroyed or used, they are placed face-up in this area.  
* **Loadout Area:** This area is specifically for Asset cards, which have persistent effects throughout the game.  
* **Battlefield:** This is the main playing area where units are deployed and battles take place. The battlefield is divided into quadrants, each contributing to unit positioning and tactical considerations.

### **C. Card Attributes**

Each card in Quantum Nexus has several key attributes:

* **Command Points (CP):** Located in the top-left corner, CP indicates the cost of playing a card. You have a limited amount of CP each Game Round, so choosing which cards to play is crucial.  
* **Type:** Cards are categorized into types such as Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, Terrain, or Mission. Each type has distinct functions and roles in the game.  
* **Subtype:** Subtypes provide further details about a card, such as its affiliation, or special abilities.  
* **Rule Box:** This section contains the card's abilities, effects, and any special conditions for using it. Understanding the rule box is essential for effective card play.  
* **Duplicates:** Some cards have restrictions on how many copies you can include in your deck. This ensures deck diversity and strategic balance. By familiarizing yourself with these components and card attributes, you'll be well-equipped to embark on your Quantum Nexus journey and build powerful decks to challenge your opponents.

## **Quantum Nexus: Core Principles**

* **Card Text Overrides Rules:** A card's specific text takes precedence over general game rules, unless a rule explicitly states it cannot be overridden (e.g., Section V.F regarding Player Areas and Card Control). If unsure, consult the official FAQ.  
* **Precision Matters:** Pay close attention to specific keywords and phrases like "target," "destroy," "may," "must," "up to," and "exactly," as they have precise game meanings.  
* **Resolve Fully and In Order:** Complete each game step and resolve each card effect fully one at a time. Follow the detailed rules for timing and priority, especially for triggered effects (see Section VII.A).  
* **Your Space, Your Stuff:** A player's cards, tokens, and components always remain in their own designated play areas and are only physically manipulated by their owner (see Section V.F).  
* **Primary Path to Victory:** An opponent is eliminated from the game if, at the end of a round, the conditions for Frontline Supremacy are met against them. This occurs when you have at least one unit in each of your front row quadrants and that opponent has no units in their front row. The last player standing is the winner.

## **II. Deck Construction**

### **Construction Basics**

In Quantum Nexus, deck construction is a critical aspect of gameplay. Your main deck (excluding Mission Cards) must contain exactly 200 Command Points (CP) worth of cards. This total includes the CP cost of all Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards in your deck. Each such card has a CP value displayed in the top left corner. When selecting these cards for your deck, you must ensure their total CP value adds up to exactly 200\. Mission cards do not count towards this 200 CP limit; their CP values contribute to the Command Points calculated at the start of each Game Round (see Section II.B and III.C.1 for details on CP calculation during the Start of Round Step). This restriction ensures balance and prevents players from overwhelming their opponents with too many powerful cards.

Within this 200 CP total, no more than 25 CP may be allocated to cards with the Leader subtype (see Section VII.D).

### **A. Deck Size**

There is no specific minimum or maximum limit on the number of individual cards in your main deck, provided the total CP of these cards (Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards) is exactly 200 as detailed in Construction Basics, and you adhere to duplicate limits printed on each card. Mission cards are separated from the main deck at the very beginning of the game setup, before any shuffling for the initial initiative flip occurs (see Section III.A).

### **B. Mission Cards**

Mission cards play a significant role in Quantum Nexus, representing your objectives during the game. Your deck can include a maximum of six Mission cards. Their primary functions are to establish your Command Point (CP) engine for the game, set the Domain Point (DP) legality for your deck's units, and provide powerful strategic abilities.

The components of a Mission Card function as follows:

* **Passive Ability:** This ability is active from the beginning of the game. It provides a constant strategic benefit that helps define your deck's core identity and function.  
* **Challenge and One-Time Ability:** The Challenge is an objective that, when completed, unlocks the card's powerful One-Time Ability. This ability should be used as a significant tempo play to establish a more dominant board state, which will in turn allow you to more effectively assault an enemy Relay Beacon or defend your own.  
* **Total Domain Points:** Mission cards are associated with six domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity, Biology, and Entropy. The total points across all domains on your Mission cards must equal exactly 6\. This ensures a diverse set of objectives and prevents focusing on a single domain.  
* **Single Domain Limit:** No single domain on your Mission cards can have more than 4 points. This further promotes balance and encourages players to explore different strategies.  
* **Zero Points Allowed:** It is acceptable to have a domain with 0 points on your Mission cards. This allows flexibility in deck building and caters to different playstyles.  
* **Mission-Derived Command Points per Game Round:** The total CP value of your chosen Mission cards determines a base amount of Command Points (CP) you will calculate during each Game Round's Start of Round Step (see Section III.C.1). For instance, if your Mission cards have a combined CP value of 18, this value contributes to your CP calculation at the start of each Game Round.

### **C. Play Cards**

Play cards form the core of your army in Quantum Nexus. They are the ones that engage in combat and fulfill mission objectives. When selecting cards for your deck, it's crucial to align them with the domains represented on your Mission cards.

Cards have domain values associated with them (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity, Biology, Entropy). When including a card in your deck, its domain value for any given domain (e.g., Technology) must be equal to or lower than the total number of points assigned to that same domain across all of your chosen Mission cards. For instance, if your collective Mission cards grant a total of 3 points in the Technology domain, any card in your deck cannot have more than 3 points in its Technology domain value. If a card has values in multiple domains, this check must be satisfied for each of those domains against the corresponding total from your Mission Cards. Crucially, this means if your Mission cards provide a total of 0 points for a specific domain, you cannot include any card in your deck that has a value greater than 0 in that same domain. There are duplicate limits printed on each card, no card may ever break these limits. They can have an amount of cards lower than the limit, but never higher. By carefully selecting Mission cards and aligning your Play cards with their domains, you can create a cohesive and powerful deck that maximizes your chances of victory in Quantum Nexus.

### **D. Sideboard Construction**

A sideboard is a separate pool of cards used to modify your main deck between games in a multi-game match. It allows a player to adapt their strategy to better counter their current opponent.

Core Construction Rules:

A legal sideboard must adhere to the following rules:

* It consists of exactly 10 cards.  
* The total CP value of these 10 cards may not exceed 40 CP.

Sideboard Legality and Usage:

* All cards in your sideboard must adhere to your deck's Mission Card DP requirements. A card is only legal in your sideboard if it would also be legal in your main deck.  
* Between games in a match, you may swap cards from your sideboard with cards in your main deck on a one-for-one basis. For each card you add to your main deck from your sideboard, you must return one card from your main deck to your sideboard.  
* After sideboarding, your main deck must still contain exactly 200 CP worth of cards.  
* Your Leader CP limit of max 25 CP must also be respected in the reconfigured main deck.

## **III. How to Play**

### **A. Game Setup**

Before determining game initiative, players prepare for the game with the following steps:

1. **Mission Card Placement:** Each player identifies their chosen Mission Cards from their constructed deck. These cards are separated from their main deck and placed face-up in that player's Mission Card Area.  
2. **Determine Base Mission CP Value:** Players sum the CP values of their Mission Cards to determine the base CP they will generate each round.

### **B. Initial Game Initiative (First Game Round)**

With Mission Cards set aside and base Mission CP value known, the next step is to determine who takes the first action of the first Game Round.

1. **Prepare Decks:** Each player takes their main deck (which now excludes Mission Cards).  
2. **Shuffle:** All players thoroughly shuffle their main decks.  
3. **Flip Top Card:** Each player simultaneously flips over the top card of their main deck. The CP value of this revealed card (which will be a Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, or Terrain card) is used for comparison.  
4. **Compare CP Values:** The player whose revealed card has the lower CP value decides who takes the first action of the first Game Round.  
5. **Tiebreaker:** If multiple players reveal cards with the same lowest CP value, or if all players reveal cards with the same CP value, those players involved in the tie continue flipping additional cards from the top of their decks until one player reveals a lower CP value than the others in the tie-breaking flip. Revealed cards from previous tie-breaking flips are set aside by those players until the tie is broken.  
6. **Reshuffle Decks:** Once the starting player is decided, all players retrieve any cards revealed during the initiative flip process and thoroughly shuffle them back into their respective decks. This ensures the deck is randomized before the first Game Round begins.

### **C. Game Round Structure**

A game of Quantum Nexus proceeds in a series of Game Rounds. Each Game Round consists of the following steps:

#### **1\. Start of Round Step (Simultaneous for all Players)**

This step occurs at the beginning of each Game Round and involves the following procedures performed by all players:

1. a. Simultaneous Refresh Actions: All players simultaneously perform the following:  
   1. Deactivate all of their previously exhausted cards (returning them to their ready state).  
   2. Gain their Command Points (CP) for the current Game Round. This is done by first resetting their current CP to zero, then summing the total CP value derived from their Mission Cards and any additional CP explicitly granted by other ongoing card effects, including Mission Card passive abilities.  
   3. Draw cards until they have five cards in their hand.  
2. b. Resolution of Action-Contingent Triggers: If any of the actions performed in step (1.a) (such as drawing a card or gaining CP) cause any card abilities to meet their trigger conditions, these triggered abilities now resolve.  
   1. All such triggered abilities across all players are considered to have triggered simultaneously.  
   2. They resolve according to the layered trigger resolution rules (Section VII.A). The player who has initiative for the current Game Round (see Section III.D) chooses the order for and resolves all of their own triggered abilities from this step first. Resolution then proceeds clockwise to other players for their abilities triggered in this step.  
3. c. Resolution of "Start of Round" Triggers: After all abilities triggered by the actions in step (1.b) have fully resolved, any abilities that specifically trigger "at the start of the Game Round" (or "at the start of the round") now resolve.  
   1. All such triggered abilities across all players are considered to have triggered simultaneously.  
   2. They also resolve according to the layered trigger resolution rules (Section VII.A). The player who has initiative for the current Game Round chooses the order for and resolves all of their own "start of round" triggered abilities first. The resolution then proceeds clockwise to other players.

Once all procedures in this "Start of Round Step," including the resolution of all triggered abilities, are complete, the game proceeds to the "Activation Sequence" for the current Game Round.

#### **2\. Activation Sequence (Alternating Single Actions)**

Following the "Start of Round Step," players proceed to the Activation Sequence.

* The player with initiative for the current Game Round (see Section III.D) takes the first single action.  
* After that action and any resulting triggered abilities (see Section VII.A) fully resolve, the next player in clockwise order takes a single action.  
* This continues, with players alternating taking one action at a time. There is no maximum limit on the amount of CP a player can spend on any single one of these actions during their activation.

Available Single Actions (Player's Choice):  
When it is a player's turn in the alternating sequence, they may choose one of the following actions, provided they can pay all associated costs:

* **Deploy a Card:** Choose one card (Unit, Asset, Terrain, or Upgrade) from their hand and pay its Command Point (CP) cost. Place the card into the appropriate area, respecting all placement rules:  
  * Units: Must be placed into a valid, friendly quadrant in the player's Back Row. The destination quadrant must not exceed the four-unit-per-quadrant limit and must also respect the 'one Leader per quadrant' and any other card specific restrictions.  
  * Assets: Placed into the Loadout Area.  
  * Terrain: Placed into any friendly Battlefield quadrant.  
  * Upgrades: Attached to a valid card.  
* **Activate an Active Ability:** Choose one of their cards in play and one of its Active Abilities. Pay all associated costs (CP, exhausting the card, etc.) as specified by the ability. The ability's effect then resolves. Unless a card's text states otherwise, Active Abilities can be chosen as an action at any point during the Activation Sequence.  
* **Declare an Attack:** Choose one of their ready units to declare an attack. The chosen unit becomes exhausted.  
  * **Targeting:** The player declares a valid defending enemy unit according to targeting rules (Range definitions in Section VIII, Multiplayer targeting \- see below). Players may target any enemy unit in valid range. In multiplayer games, when a player declares an attack, they must also declare which opponent they are targeting. For the purpose of any player's turn, their front row will always face every other player's front row when determining range and targeting against an opponent.

**Calculating Defender's Effective Defense:** Before comparing Attack vs. Defense, the defender's effective Defense for this combat is calculated by summing:

* Its base Defense value.  
* **Back Row Bonus:** \+1 Defense if the defending unit is in its controller's Back Row.  
* Any other defense modifiers from card effects.  
  * **Combat Resolution:** Compare the Attacker's Attack value (A) with the Defender's calculated *Effective Defense value (D)*:  
    * **If A \> D:** The defending unit is destroyed. It is sent to its owner's Discard Pile, unless an ability or keyword (such as Nullify) causes it to be removed from the game instead.  
    * **If A \= D:** The defending unit becomes **`Suppressed`**. (A `Suppressed` unit becomes exhausted. See Glossary, Section VIII for the full effects of the `Suppressed` state).  
    * **If A \< D:** The defending unit survives and is unaffected.  
* **Play an Event Card:** Choose one Event card from their hand and pay its CP cost. The Event card's effect resolves, and then it is typically placed in the Discard Pile. Unless an Event card's text states otherwise, it can be played as an action at any point during the Activation Sequence.  
* **Move a Unit**: Choose one of their ready units. That unit moves one quadrant in a cardinal direction (Forward, Backward, Left, or Right) to an adjacent friendly quadrant. The destination quadrant may be occupied by other friendly units, provided the total number of units does not exceed the four-unit limit. The unit that moved then becomes exhausted as the cost of this action.  
* **Pass:** The player chooses to take no other action. The Activation Sequence ends when all players consecutively Pass.  
* **Concede:** A player may concede at any time. Conceding a game means that player automatically loses and immediately leaves the game.

#### **3\. Ending the Activation Sequence**

The Activation Sequence for the Game Round ends when all players, in clockwise order, consecutively "Pass" their action. After the sequence ends, a new Game Round begins with the "Start of Round Step," unless a winner has been determined.

### **D. Initiative in Game Rounds**

Initiative determines which player takes the first action in a Game Round's Activation Sequence.

1. **Initial Game Initiative (First Game Round):** Determined as described in Section III.B.  
2. **Subsequent Round Initiative (Round 2 onwards):** The player who "passed first" to initiate the final, uninterrupted sequence of passes that ended the *previous* Game Round's Activation Sequence will take the first action in the new Game Round.  
3. **First Action Advantage:** No specific compensation (like extra CP or cards) is given to the player acting second in a Game Round's Activation Sequence. The system for determining initiative and the alternating nature of actions are considered sufficient for balance.

## **IV. Card Types**

Quantum Nexus boasts a diverse range of card types, each playing a unique role in shaping your strategy and determining the course of battles. Understanding the functions and characteristics of these card types is crucial for mastering the game.

### **A. Units**

As a 'Deploy a Card' action, Units are always deployed into a quadrant on the player's Back Row. To engage further, a unit must be moved from the Back Row to the Front Row by using a "Move a Unit" action during one of the player's subsequent activations in the Activation Sequence. A player's units never enter an opponent's quadrants or play area.

* **Attack Value:** This number, located on the left side of the card, represents the unit's offensive strength used in combat resolution.  
* **Defense Value:** This number, located on the right side of the card, represents the unit's resilience used in combat resolution. (see Section III.C.2).  
* **Attack Range:** Each unit has an attack range (Close, Mid, or Far) that dictates the pool of valid targets it can choose from, which may include quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield or on the attacking player's own side, relative to its current position within its own quadrants. (See Glossary, Section VIII).  
* **Leaders:** Some units are designated as Leaders, possessing enhanced abilities and stats. Only one of a player's Leaders can occupy one of their quadrants at a time; no other Leader controlled by that same player may be moved or deployed into a quadrant that already contains one of their Leaders.

A single quadrant has a capacity of four units. This limit must be respected when deploying or moving units. This does not override the 'one Leader per quadrant' or 'one Massive per quadrant' rules. Certain keywords, like Large, may provide specific exceptions to this four-unit limit.

Units may become Leaders, or existing Leaders might have their state altered, through card-specific abilities or effects found in the rule box of cards such as Events, Upgrades, or as part of other card abilities. These are sometimes generally referred to as 'transformation' effects. The specific rules, conditions, and outcomes of such transformations are detailed on the individual cards that enable them. Unless a card's text explicitly overrides general game rules, all standard Leader limitations (e.g., the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule) and the procedures for resolving simultaneous Leader entries into a single quadrant apply when a unit becomes or changes into a Leader due to such a card effect. For instance, if an effect attempts to transform a unit into a Leader in a quadrant already occupied by another of that player's Leaders, and the transforming card does not provide a specific exception, the transformation would fail for that unit in that quadrant according to the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule.

* **Resolving Simultaneous Leader Entries:** If multiple game effects attempt to simultaneously cause more than one of a single player's Leader units to enter or exist in the same quadrant (through deployment, movement, or transformation), the following occurs: The player whose current action or resolving effect is causing the entries (or the player with initiative for the Game Round in the case of simultaneous Start of Round triggers) determines the order in which these simultaneous effects attempt to resolve.  
  * For each effect in sequence: If resolving it would result in more than one of that player's Leaders being in the target quadrant, that specific effect fails, and the Leader is not deployed, moved, or transformed.  
  * If an effect successfully places a Leader, and this now means a subsequent simultaneous effect (if it were to resolve) would cause a violation, that subsequent effect will fail when its turn comes to be considered.  
  * In essence, once a Leader successfully occupies a quadrant, no other Leader controlled by the same player can enter that quadrant as part of the same batch of simultaneous effects, even if another effect in that batch would subsequently move the first Leader out. The 'one Leader per quadrant' rule is checked at the point each individual simultaneous effect attempts to resolve. (Deck construction limits for Leaders are in Section II and Section VII.D).

It's important to note how this interacts with the general resolution of triggered abilities (Section VII.A) when multiple distinct effects are involved: If several different triggered effects (which are resolving according to the layered process described in Section VII.A) would each independently lead to simultaneous attempts for more than one of a single player's units to enter or exist as a Leader in the same quadrant, the overall order in which those distinct effects attempt to resolve **is governed by Section VII.A**. When the resolution of any individual effect (or a single effect with multiple such consequences) prompts a situation where that player's units would simultaneously attempt to become Leaders, the player controlling those units and the quadrant then applies the rules detailed above in this section: they choose the order for their own units' entry attempts, and each attempt **is validated against the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule** at its point of attempted resolution.

### **B. Assets**

Assets are persistent cards that remain in the controlling player's Loadout Area throughout the game, providing ongoing benefits or activating special abilities. They are deployed as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence. They differ from Units in that they have a Defense value but no Attack value. Assets inherently cannot declare an Attack (Action), as this action is exclusive to Units. If an Upgrade or other card effect grants an Attack value to an Asset, this Attack value may be referenced by other card abilities or effects (e.g., 'Destroy an Asset with an Attack value of X or more'), but it does not grant the Asset the ability to perform an Attack (Action) itself. Assets primarily influence the game through their printed abilities and persistent effects from the Loadout Area, not through direct combat participation as attackers.

* **Defense Value:** Similar to Units, Assets have a Defense value that determines how much damage they can withstand.  
* **Loadout Area:** Unlike Units, Assets are not deployed onto the battlefield but are instead placed in the controlling player's Loadout Area. This protects them from direct attacks by enemy units.  
* **Activation:** Asset Active Abilities can be chosen as an 'Activate an Active Ability' action during the Activation Sequence, granting various effects such as boosting friendly units, hindering opponents, or manipulating the battlefield.  
* **Persistent Effects:** Some Assets provide continuous passive effects that influence the game state for as long as they remain in play.

### **C. Events**

Event cards are powerful tools that can significantly impact the course of a game. These cards are played from hand as a 'Play an Event Card' action during the Activation Sequence and offer one-time effects before being discarded to the owner's Discard Pile. Unless an Event card's text specifies otherwise, it can be played at any point during the Activation Sequence when a player is taking an action.

* **One-Time Use:** Unlike Units and Assets, Events are not persistent and are discarded immediately after their effect resolves.  
* **Powerful Effects:** Events can range from destroying units, inflicting Impact, manipulating card positions, or granting temporary bonuses.

### **D. Upgrades**

Upgrades are cards that modify other cards on the battlefield, enhancing their abilities or granting them new ones. They are deployed as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence. These cards typically attach to a player's own Units or Assets and remain in play as long as the modified card does.

* **Modifying Attack and Defense:** Upgrades can increase or decrease the Attack and Defense values of the attached card, making them stronger or weaker in combat.  
* **Additional Effects:** Many Upgrades grant additional abilities or effects to the attached card, expanding its tactical potential.

### **E. Terrain**

Terrain cards represent different environments on the battlefield and affect the units within specific quadrants. These cards are deployed as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence into a player's own quadrants on their side of the Battlefield and remain in play until removed by a card effect. A player may only deploy Terrain cards into any of the quadrants on their own side of the Battlefield.

* **Quadrant Effects:** Each Terrain card applies any passive effect described in its rule box to all units located in the specific quadrant on the owning player's side of the Battlefield where the Terrain is active. These effects can range from stat bonuses to special abilities or restrictions. Terrain cards do not provide an inherent defense bonus; their effects are determined solely by their printed rule box text.  
* **Limited Placement:** A player can have a maximum of two of their own Terrain cards active in any single one of their quadrants at any given time. For example, Player A can have up to two Terrain cards in their Front Left quadrant; this does not affect how many Terrain cards Player B can have in Player B's Front Left quadrant.  
* **Stacking Terrain Effects:** If two Terrain cards are active in the same quadrant, their effects are cumulative unless specified otherwise on the cards. If Terrain effects provide numerical modifiers (e.g., one grants "+1 Attack" and another grants "-1 Attack" to the same units), these numerical modifiers are combined (e.g., \+1 and \-1 result in a net \+0). If a non-numerical effect from a Terrain card active in a quadrant explicitly negates, prevents, or forbids an action, state, or condition that another non-numerical effect active in or targeting that same quadrant (whether from another Terrain card, a Unit ability, an Event card, or any other game source) explicitly permits, enables, or creates, and the rules do not specify a hierarchy (e.g., 'card effects override game rules'), then neither of those specific, directly conflicting effects is applied.

A note on the 'neither applies' rule for conflicting non-numerical effects: This resolution is a specific design choice. It aims to provide a clear outcome when two powerful, opposing states would otherwise create ambiguity (e.g., an effect stating a unit 'cannot use abilities' and another stating the same unit 'may use an additional ability'). Instead of establishing a complex hierarchy of which effect type always 'wins,' this rule neutralizes the directly opposing parts of such effects. This encourages players to be strategically aware of how their persistent effects interact and prevents certain combinations from unintentionally dominating the game state. Other, non-conflicting effects from the involved cards still apply. As always, if the nature of a conflict remains unclear, consult card-specific rulings or the official FAQ.

Card-specific rulings or the official FAQ should be consulted if the nature of a conflict remains unclear.

## **V. Areas of Play**

Quantum Nexus utilizes several distinct areas where cards are played and interacted with. Understanding these areas and their functions is essential for smooth gameplay and strategic decision-making.

### **A. Mission Card Area**

Located prominently above the playing area, the Mission Card Area is where players place their chosen Mission cards face-up at the beginning of the game from their own deck. This area serves two primary purposes:

* **Visibility:** By placing Mission cards face-up, all players can easily see each other's objectives. This transparency ensures fairness and allows players to strategize accordingly.  
* **Reference:** Throughout the game, players can refer to their Mission cards to track their progress and plan their actions. Completing mission objectives is a key victory condition in Quantum Nexus.

### **B. Deck**

The Deck is the heart of each player's arsenal, containing their carefully constructed collection of cards (excluding Mission Cards after initial setup).

* **Starting Point:** At the beginning of the game, after Mission Cards are removed and after the initiative flip and subsequent reshuffle, each player's main Deck is placed face-down in their designated Deck area.  
* **Drawing Cards:** During the Start of Round Step, players draw cards from their own Deck to replenish their hand and gain access to new options.

### **C. Discard Pile**

The Discard Pile serves as a repository for cards that are no longer in play from that player's hand, deck, or their side of the battlefield/loadout area.

* **Discarding Cards:** Cards are sent to their owner's Discard Pile when they are destroyed in battle, used for their effects, or discarded due to other game mechanics.  
* **Face-Up Placement:** Discarded cards are placed face-up in the owner's Discard Pile, allowing all players to see which cards have been used or eliminated.

### **D. Loadout Area**

The Loadout Area is a designated space for each player's Asset cards.

* **Asset Placement:** When Asset cards are played from a player's hand, they are not placed on the battlefield like Units. Instead, they are placed face-up in the owner's Loadout Area.  
* **Protection:** Assets in the Loadout Area are immune to direct attacks from enemy units, offering a degree of protection. However, they can still be targeted by certain card abilities or effects.  
* **Ongoing Effects:** Assets typically provide continuous benefits or activate powerful abilities, making them valuable strategic assets.

### **E. Battlefield**

The Battlefield is the central arena where Units are deployed and battles unfold. It is divided into distinct zones for each player.

* **Quadrants:** The Battlefield for each player consists of six quadrants: Front Left, Front Center, Front Right (collectively the 'Front Row' of quadrants), and Back Left, Back Center, Back Right (collectively the 'Back Row' of quadrants). These quadrants dictate unit positioning within a player's own area and their potential attack ranges against opponents or even their own units. For precise definitions of directional terms used to describe movement and targeting on the battlefield, refer to the 'Directional Terms on the Battlefield' section in the Glossary (Section VIII).  
* **Front Row and Back Row:** The terms 'Front Row' and 'Back Row' refer to these collective sets of quadrants.  
* **Flanks and Center:** The Battlefield is also considered in terms of columns (Left, Center, Right) often referred to as flanks (Left, Right) and Center. These offer strategic options for unit placement and movement within a player's own side.  
* **Attack Range:** Each Unit card has a designated attack range (Close, Mid, or Far) that determines the pool of valid targets from which it can choose a defender. This pool may include quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield or, in some cases, quadrants on the attacking player's own side, depending on the unit's current position within its owner's quadrants. (See Glossary, Section VIII).

### **F. Player Areas and Card Control**

Each player controls their own set of Battlefield quadrants (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Back Left, Back Center, Back Right), their Mission Card Area, their Deck, their Discard Pile, and their Loadout Area. Unless a card effect or game rule specifically states otherwise, players may only deploy, move, or place their cards and effects into their own areas of play. A player's cards will never leave their own play area (Battlefield quadrants, Loadout Area, Discard Pile, Deck, Hand, Mission Card Area) to enter an opponent's play area. Players may not physically move, touch, or otherwise manipulate cards or components within an opponent's designated play areas, except when an opponent's card is destroyed as a result of gameplay and is then moved by its owner to their own Discard Pile. This rule is absolute: Never will a player touch another player's card for any other reason. No card effect will ever break this rule; it is forbidden by design. Any card effect that results in an opponent's card changing zones, being modified, or otherwise affected must be physically carried out by the card's owner, even if the decision or targeting is made by the player activating the effect.

## **VI. Winning the Game**

In Quantum Nexus, when a player achieves Frontline Supremacy against an opponent, that opponent is eliminated from the game. An eliminated player removes all of their cards and components from all game areas. Their turn is skipped for the remainder of the game. Play continues in clockwise order, skipping the turn of any eliminated players. The game continues until only one player remains. That player is the winner.

### **VII. The Priority Chain and Effect Resolution**

All triggered abilities are resolved using a sequence called the **Priority Chain**. This system ensures that effects are handled in a structured, predictable order. The fundamental principle is **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)**; the last effect added to the Chain is the first one to resolve.

**A. Triggered Ability Resolution**

The Priority Chain is built and resolved in two circumstances: 1\. After a player Action (Deploy, Attack, etc.) fully resolves, any abilities that were triggered by that action are added to the chain. 2\. When a player **Activates an Event** from their hand by meeting its 'Trigger' condition.

When a player Activates an Event from their hand, its effect is added to the Priority Chain. If a Priority Chain is already being built or is in a Response Window, the Activated Event's effect is added to the top of the existing chain as the next available Chain Link. If no Priority Chain is active, the Activated Event starts a new Priority Chain and its effect becomes Chain Link 1\.

**1\. Building the Priority Chain**

The Chain is built in a specific sequence:

1. **Initial Triggers (Priority Player):** The player whose turn it is, or the player whose action caused the initial triggers (the "**Priority Player**"), identifies all of their abilities that were triggered by the event \[cite: 319-320\]. They place these abilities onto the Priority Chain in an order of their choosing. The first ability placed on the Chain is **Chain Link 1**, the second is **Chain Link 2**, and so on.  
2. **Initial Triggers (Opponents):** Following the Priority Player, each other player, proceeding in clockwise order, places all of their abilities triggered by the same event onto the Priority Chain \[cite: 321-322\].

**2\. The Response Window**

After all initial triggers have been placed on the Chain, a single **Response Window** opens.

1. Starting with the Priority Player and proceeding in clockwise order, each player has one opportunity to activate any of their triggered abilities, provided the ability's trigger condition has been met by the current game state.  
2. Any such ability is added to the top of the Priority Chain as a new Chain Link.  
3. If a player activates an ability or passes, their opportunity to act during this Response Window ends.  
4. Once all players have consecutively passed, the Response Window closes. No further effects can be added to the Chain.

**3\. Resolving the Priority Chain**

Once the Response Window is closed, the Chain resolves completely and without interruption.

1. Effects on the Chain are resolved one by one, starting from the **highest Chain Link number** and proceeding downward to Chain Link 1 (Last-In, First-Out).  
2. As an effect resolves, follow the instructions on its card text.  
3. Any abilities that would be triggered by an effect resolving on the Chain are ignored.  
4. **Handling Invalid Targets:** The validity of an effect's targets is checked upon resolution.  
   * If **all** of an effect's mandatory targets are no longer legal when it resolves (e.g., a unit was destroyed by a higher Chain Link), the effect fails to resolve and does nothing. This is often called "fizzling."  
   * If an effect has **multiple targets** and some, but not all, become illegal, the effect resolves as much as possible against the remaining legal targets.  
5. After the entire Chain has resolved, the game proceeds.

**7.A.4. Example of the Priority Chain in Action**

* **Event:** Player A (the Priority Player) deploys a "Nexus Engineer" unit. This triggers its own ability and an ability of an Asset controlled by Player B.  
* **Building the Chain:**  
  * Player A places the "Nexus Engineer's" ability ("*When this unit is deployed, draw a card*") onto the Chain as **Chain Link 1** \[cite: 309, 319-320\].  
  * Player B places their "Automated Turret's" ability ("*When an opponent deploys a unit, you may inflict 2 Impact on it*") onto the Chain as **Chain Link 2**.  
* **Response Window:**  
  * The placement of the "Automated Turret's" ability on the Chain meets the trigger condition for Player A's "Shield Matrix" Event card in hand, which reads: "*Trigger: When an opponent's ability that targets one of your units is placed on the Priority Chain, you may activate this ability. Effect: Target friendly unit cannot be affected by opponent's effects this turn.*"  
  * Player A activates this triggered ability. It becomes **Chain Link 3**.  
  * Player B has no abilities to activate and passes. The Response Window closes.  
* **Resolving the Chain (Top Down):**  
  * **Chain Link 3 resolves:** "Shield Matrix's" ability resolves, making the "Nexus Engineer" immune.  
  * **Chain Link 2 resolves:** "Automated Turret" attempts to inflict Impact. Upon resolution, its target is now illegal. The effect "fizzles."  
  * **Chain Link 1 resolves:** "Nexus Engineer's" ability resolves, and Player A draws a card.  
* The Priority Chain is now empty. The game continues.

7.A.5. Example Triggered Event

**Example Card Template:**

* **Card Name:** Cognitive Override  
* **Type:** Event  
* **Domain:** Psionics 3  
* **CP Cost:** 4  
* **Rule Box:**  
  **Trigger:** When an opponent plays an Event card, you may pay this card's CP cost to **Activate** it from your hand.  
  **Effect:** The opponent's Event card has its effect negated (it is considered to have no rule box text). Draw a card.

### **B. Card Type Counts (Leader Limit)**

Each deck can't have any more then 25 CP worth of Leader Unit cards. This 25 CP is part of the overall 200 CP limit for the main deck. Each card type has very specific strengths and weaknesses that can only be balanced with a thought-out and diverse army.

## **VIII. Glossary of Terms**

To help you fully grasp the intricacies of Quantum Nexus, here is a glossary of essential terms used throughout the game:

### **Directional Terms on the Battlefield**

* **Forward:**  
  * *Within a Player's Own Side:* The direction from a unit's current quadrant in their Back Row towards the quadrant in the same column in their own Front Row.  
  * *Towards an Opponent's Side:* The direction from a unit's current quadrant (typically in the active player's Front Row) towards the corresponding quadrant (same column) in a declared opponent's Front Row.  
  * *General Principle:* "Forward" always indicates movement or orientation away from the active player's board edge and towards an opponent's side, or from a player's Back Row towards their Front Row.  
  * *Multiplayer Context:* In multiplayer games, "Forward" is always oriented towards the specific opponent who has been declared as the target for the current action or effect. This aligns with the rule (Section III.C.2) that a player's Front Row is considered to be facing the declared opponent's Front Row for targeting purposes.  
* **Backward:**  
  * *Within a Player's Own Side:* The direction from a unit's current quadrant in their Front Row towards the quadrant in the same column in their own Back Row.  
  * *General Principle:* "Backward" always indicates movement or orientation away from the opponent's side and towards the active player's own board edge, or from a player's Front Row towards their Back Row.  
  * A unit cannot target, move, or have its position referenced "Backward" off the playable area of its controller's side of the battlefield.  
* **Left:**  
  * The direction from a unit's current quadrant to an existing, horizontally adjacent quadrant towards the active player's left-hand side, typically within the same row (Front or Back Row).  
* **Right:**  
  * The direction from a unit's current quadrant to an existing, horizontally adjacent quadrant towards the active player's right-hand side, typically within the same row (Front or Back Row).  
* **Diagonal Directions:**  
  * These are compound directions derived from the cardinal directions. For example:  
    * Forward-Left: The quadrant that is one step Forward and one step Left from the point of origin.  
    * Backward-Right: The quadrant that is one step Backward and one step Right from the point of origin.  
  * All component directions of a diagonal movement or reference must correspond to existing quadrants on the battlefield to be valid.  
* **Action (Player):** During the Activation Sequence of a Game Round, when it is their turn, a player chooses to perform one Action. Available Actions are: Deploy a Card, Activate an Active Ability, Declare an Attack, Play an Event Card, Move a Unit, or Pass.  
* **Activate:** To choose to use a card's Active Ability as an Action, paying its costs. Also refers to the process of resolving Interrupts.  
* **Active Ability:** An ability identified in a card's rule box that a player must consciously choose to use as their Action during the Activation Sequence. Activating it usually requires paying costs (like CP) and often requires exhausting the card. Unless a card's text specifies other timing restrictions, Active Abilities can be used at any point during the Activation Sequence when a player takes an Action. Passive Abilities are not "activated" in this way.  
* **Activate an Event:** To play an Event card from your hand outside of the normal Activation Sequence by meeting the condition of its "Trigger" ability. Activating an Event is not considered a player Action. When an Event is Activated, its effect is added to the Priority Chain, becoming the next available link on an existing chain or starting a new chain as Chain Link 1 if no chain is active.  
* **Activation Sequence:** The main part of a Game Round where players take turns performing single Actions in clockwise order until all players consecutively Pass.  
* **Arcane Recall (X):** A card with this ability may be played from its owner's discard pile by paying X Command Points instead of its normal cost. If a card is played using Arcane Recall, it is removed from the game after its effect resolves.  
* **Asset:** A card type that can be deployed into the controlling player's Loadout Area. Deploying an Asset is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.  
* **Attack (Action):** See 'Declare an Attack.'  
* **Attack Value (A):** This number represents the unit's offensive strength. Used in combat resolution (see Section III.C.2).  
* **Battlefield:** The central playing area where units are deployed and battles take place.  
* **Close Range:** A unit with a Close Range attack or ability can target its own current quadrant AND one existing quadrant directly Forward, Backward, Left, and Right of its current quadrant. This results in targeting up to 5 quadrants. A unit declaring an attack with Close Range may target its own unit in its own quadrant.  
* **Command Points (CP):** A resource used to deploy cards and activate abilities. Players gain CP during the Start of Round Step.  
* **Deactivate:** The action of returning an exhausted card to its ready (upright) state, performed during the Start of Round Step.  
* **Declare an Attack:** An Action a player can take with one of their ready units. The unit exhausts. Combat resolution follows (see Section III.C.2), resulting in potential destruction, or possibly, the defender being Suppressed.  
* **Deck:** A player's collection of cards from which they draw during the Start of Round Step.  
* **Defense Value (D):** This number represents a unit's resilience. Its effective value in combat is calculated by adding its Back Row bonus (+1D) and any other card effects to its base value, as described in Section III.C.2..  
* **Domain:** A thematic category associated with all cards.  
* **Event:** A card type that provides a one-time effect. An Event can be **Played** from hand as an Action during a player's turn in the Activation Sequence, or it can be **Activated** from hand if its 'Trigger' ability's condition is met.  
* **Evolve**: A card with Evolve may be Deployed by paying its CP Cost as normal, but it can also be played by paying its Evolve CP cost and placing it on the named card it is evolving from. Evolving does not count as a deployment.  
* **Exhaust:** To turn a card sideways from its ready position. Required for Declaring an Attack, Moving a Unit, or using certain Active Abilities. Exhausted cards are deactivated during the Start of Round Step.  
* **Far Range:** An attack range allowing a unit to target all quadrants located exactly two rows ahead of its current row, on an opponent's side of the battlefield. Units in a player's Front Row target all quadrants in the opponent's Back Row. Units in a player's Back Row target all quadrants in the opponent's Front Row. Far Range does not include the attacking unit's own current quadrant.  
* **Flank:** The left and right columns of quadrants on a player's side of the battlefield.  
* **Friendly Unit:** A unit controlled by the same player.  
* **Front Row:** The row of three quadrants on a player's side of the battlefield closest to the opposing side(s). Does not inherently prevent targeting of back-row units.  
* **Game Round:** The main cycle of play. Consists of a "Start of Round Step" and an "Activation Sequence."  
* **Initiative:** Determines which player takes the first Action in a Game Round's Activation Sequence. See Section III.B for initial game initiative and Section III.D for subsequent round initiative.  
* **Leader:** A powerful Unit card with deployment restrictions (one per quadrant, deck limits).  
* **Loadout Area:** A designated area for Asset cards.  
* **Mid Range:** A unit with a Mid Range attack or ability can target one existing quadrant directly Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Forward-Left Diagonal, Forward-Right Diagonal, Backward-Left Diagonal, and Backward-Right Diagonal from its current quadrant, this is a total of 8 targetable quadrants surrounding the units current quadrant. Mid Range does not include the attacking unit's own current quadrant.  
* **Mission Card:** A card representing an objective.  
* **Move (Action):** An Action a player can take with one of their ready units. The unit moves one quadrant in a cardinal direction to an adjacent friendly quadrant (respecting Leader limits; destination can be occupied by other friendly non-Leaders). The unit then becomes exhausted.  
* **Nullify (Keyword):** A keyword found on attacking units. When a unit with Nullify destroys a defending unit that has the Static state as a result of an attack (where the attacker's Attack is greater than the defender's Defense), the defending unit is removed from the game instead of being placed in its owner's Discard Pile.  
* **Opposing Unit:** A unit controlled by an opponent.  
* **Passive Ability:** An ability that is always active and does not require being chosen as an Action to use. Unless specified otherwise by an effect, Passive Abilities remain active even if a unit is Suppressed.  
* **Phantom**: An opponent cannot target a unit with this keyword with attacks or abilities until after it has performed an action during the current Game Round (Attack, Move, Rulebox Ability, etc).  
* **Priority Chain:** The ordered sequence of triggered abilities and Interrupts that are waiting to be resolved. The Chain is resolved in a 'Last-In, First-Out' (LIFO) order.  
* **Priority Player:** The player whose turn it is, or the player who took the most recent action that triggered one or more abilities. The Priority Player is the first to place their abilities on the Priority Chain and act during the Response Window.  
* **Quadrant:** One of the six sections of a player's side of the battlefield. A quadrant has a general capacity of four units and is subject to additional restrictions from keywords like Leader and Massive. A keyword may change the size of a unit, but the sum of units in the quadrant can't exceed four regular sized units. Some examples are: 1 Massive unit per quadrant and that is it. 1 Large unit and 2 regular sized units. 4 Tiny units, a regular sized unit, and a Large unit.  
* **Ready:** The normal, upright orientation of a card. Only Ready units may take actions.  
* **Response Window:** A specific point in the game, after initial triggers are placed on the Priority Chain, where players may activate any triggered ability whose trigger condition has been met.  
* **Ritual**: A type of powerful activated ability, primarily found on Divinity cards, that requires multiple friendly units to exhaust themselves over one or more turns to "join" the Ritual. The powerful final effect only occurs once a specific number of units have joined, as detailed in the card's rule box.  
* **Rule Box:** The section of a card that details its abilities.  
* **Start of Round Step:** The first step of each Game Round (see Section III.C.1).  
* **Subtype:** A more specific classification of a card's type.  
* **Suppressed (State):** A state applied to a defending unit when an attacking unit's Attack value exactly equals the defender's effective Defense.  
* A unit entering the `Suppressed` state becomes exhausted.  
* **If a unit that is already `Suppressed` is targeted by a new attack, it is immediately destroyed as if the defense value was 0\.**  
* **The Suppressed state is removed if the unit is deactivated/readied, generally during its controller's Start of Round Step.**  
* **Synaptic Mark (State):** A negative state that can be applied to units by card effects. A unit with a Synaptic Mark is unaffected by the state itself, but can be targeted by specific card abilities that require its presence for an enhanced or unique effect.  
* **Targeting:** The process by which a card's range or ability defines a pool of valid targets.  
* **Terrain:** A card type deployed into an owner's quadrant that applies effects described in its rule box. Terrain cards do not provide an inherent defense bonus. See Section IV.E. Deploying Terrain is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.  
* **Triggered Ability:** An ability that enables an effect when a specific condition is met. Triggered abilities on cards in play are placed on the Priority Chain to resolve. A Triggered ability on an Event card in hand may allow that Event to be **Activated**.  
* **Unit:** A card type representing characters or vehicles. Deploying a Unit is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.  
* **Upgrade:** A card type that modifies another card. Deploying an Upgrade is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.  
* **Zeal**: The first time a unit with this keyword would be destroyed each Game Round, it is instead Supressed.

## **IX. Advanced Gameplay Concepts**

### **A. Resource Management and Tempo**

Command Points (CP) are your lifeblood. Mastering their use is key to victory. Prioritize which cards to deploy or abilities to activate as your action during the Activation Sequence based on the game's flow and your strategic goals.

* **Tempo:** This refers to the pace at which you utilize your CP and actions within a Game Round's alternating Activation Sequence. A well-timed action can disrupt your opponent's plans or seize an advantage. Overspending CP on early actions in a round may leave you with fewer options for your subsequent actions in that same round. Strive for a balance that maintains pressure while leaving resources for adapting to the unexpected.

### **B. Card Advantage and Board Control**

In Quantum Nexus, numbers matter. Card advantage, having more resources than your opponent, can be achieved through:

* **Efficient Trades:** Destroy enemy units (or apply tactical states like Suppressed) while minimizing your own losses or resource expenditure.  
* **Card Draw Effects:** Utilize cards that let you draw additional cards, expanding your options.  
* **Disruption:** Force your opponent to discard cards or waste resources/actions. Controlling the battlefield (board control) goes hand-in-hand with card advantage. Strategic unit placement within your own quadrants, tactical movement, and utilizing terrain for defensive bonuses can limit your opponent's options and give you the upper hand.

### **Keywords**

* **Adapt (X):** The first time a unit with this keyword is attacked each round but is not destroyed, its biology goes into overdrive, and you immediately place X \+1/+1 counters on it.  
* **Zenith:** is a keyword and subtype for a specialized unit that occupies a battlefield quadrant to interact with an opponent's Assets. Zenithunits generally cannot perform the "Declare an Attack" action; their specific methods for interacting with Assets are detailed in their individual rule boxes.  
* **Evolve(X):** A player may pay the CP cost of the unit to deploy, or pay the Evolve cost to place this card onto a named card to evolve it. Evolving a card does not count as a deployment and for all intents and purposes the evolved card replaced the original. Evolved cards can also be de-evolved.  
* **Consume**: A keyword ability that triggers when the unit with this keyword destroys an enemy unit, typically as a result of an attack. The specific benefit gained from the Consume trigger—such as creating token units, gaining \+1/+1 counters, or another effect—is detailed in the card's rule box. If a unit has multiple instances of Consume from different sources, each triggers separately.  
* **Impact:** A persistent and accumulating value tracked by each unit and asset. When an effect "inflicts Impact X" on a target, X is added to that target's permanent accumulated Impact total. Immediately after a target's accumulated Impact total changes, if the new total is equal to or greater than the target's current Defense value, the target is destroyed. This total does not reset at the end of a Game Round.  
* **Infiltrator:** You may deploy this unit directly into any of your Front Row quadrants. This overrides the general rule that units must be deployed to the Back Row. (See also: Mission Card "Exploit Backdoor")  
* **Massive:** A Massive unit is equal in size to four regular units. A quadrant can hold only 1 Massive unit.  
* **Large:** A Large Unit is equal in size to two regular units. A quadrant can only hold 2 Large units.  
* **Small:** A Small unit is equal in size to a half of a regular unit. A quadrant can hold eight Small units.  
* **Static:** When static is inflicted the units rulebox is blanked until the start of the next Game Round.  
* **Tiny:** A Tiny unit is equal in size to a quarter of a regular unit. A quadrant can hold 16 Tiny units.  
* **Phalanx:** This unit has \+1 Defense for each adjacent friendly unit that also has the Phalanx keyword. "Adjacent" refers to any friendly quadrant (including diagonally) that is next to this unit's quadrant. The Defense bonus is dynamic and is recalculated whenever the number of adjacent friendly Phalanx units changes.  
* **Skirmisher:** After this unit performs an Attack action, you may immediately move it to an adjacent friendly quadrant. This special move does not exhaust the unit and does not cost an action.  
* **Steadfast:** This unit cannot be moved from its quadrant by an opponent's card effects.  
* **Swarm:** When taking a "Deploy a Card" action to deploy a unit with the Swarm keyword, you may also deploy any number of other units with the Swarm keyword from your hand into the same quadrant during the same action. You must pay the CP cost for all units deployed. Swarm units must still respect the quadrants four-unit limit.  
* **Horde:** When taking an “Attack” action with a unit that has the Horde keyword, you may select any number of other units with the Horde keyword in the same quadrant to attack. All attack values are added together for the purposes of combat resolution and all units are exhausted together.  
* **Taunt:** Enemy units that are able to attack must target a unit with Taunt if one is in range and a valid target. If there are multiple enemy units with Taunt, the attacking player may choose which one to target.  
* **Territorial:** Blocks enemy deployment and movement into any adjacent quadrant. A quadrant is considered adjacent if it shares a cardinal border within your own area, or if it is the corresponding Front Row quadrant of an opponent. No other quadrants between opposing battlefields are considered adjacent.

### **C. Adapting to Your Opponent**

Every opponent brings a unique deck and strategy. Stay observant, analyze their choices during the alternating Activation Sequence, and adapt your tactics action by action to counter their approach. Flexibility is key; don't be afraid to shift your game plan if your initial strategy falters.

### **D. Psychological Warfare**

Sometimes, the most potent weapon is your opponent's mind. Calculated bluffs (e.g., passing an action despite having CP), misdirection, and unexpected plays during the Activation Sequence can create openings and sow doubt.

## **X. Expansions**

Expansions typically introduce new card sets, expanding the pool of available cards and opening up new possibilities for deck building and strategy. They often introduce new keywords, abilities, and even new card types, adding layers of depth to the game.

* **New Missions:** Expansions can also add new Mission cards with different objectives and rewards, expanding the range of strategic options available.  
* **Balancing Changes:** Expansions may also include balance adjustments to existing cards, ensuring a fair and competitive environment.

## **XIII. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **A. Gameplay Questions**

* **Q: How is the first player to act in a Game Round determined?**  
* A: For the first Game Round, players flip the top card of their deck; the player revealing the lower CP card decides who acts first. For subsequent Game Rounds, the player who passed first to end the previous round's Activation Sequence acts first. (See Section III.B and III.D).  
* **Q: What actions can I take during my activation in the Activation Sequence?**  
* A: You can choose one of the following: Deploy a Card, Activate an Active Ability, Declare an Attack, Play an Event Card, Move a Unit, or Pass. (See Section III.C.2).  
* **Q: What happens if a unit's Attack (A) equals a defender's effective Defense (D) in battle?**  
* A: The defending unit becomes `Suppressed`. A `Suppressed` unit is exhausted and is now vulnerable; if it is targeted by another attack this round, it will be destroyed. (See Glossary: `Suppressed`).  
* **Q: What happens if an attacker's Attack (A) is less than a defender's effective Defense (D) in battle?**  
* A: The defender is unaffected. The attacking unit is still exhausted for having declared the attack.  
* **Q: What happens if I attack a `Suppressed` unit?** **A:** If you declare an attack against a unit that is already in the `Suppressed` state, that unit is immediately destroyed. Your attacking unit exhausts as normal for declaring the attack. (See Glossary: Suppressed).  
* **Q: Can I play Event cards or use Active Abilities at any time?**  
* A: You can play an Event card or use an Active Ability as your chosen action during your turn in the Activation Sequence, assuming you can pay all costs and meet any conditions on the card. There are no general restrictions based on previous game phases, but individual cards may have specific timing requirements in their text. (See Section III.C.2).  
* **Q: Can I target units in an opponent's back row with a direct attack even if there are units in their front row?**  
* A: Yes. You can target any enemy unit that is within your attacking unit's valid range. Back-row units may have additional defensive bonuses based on friendly units or Terrain in front of them. (See Section III.C.2).  
* **Q: How does the "Move" action work?**  
* A: As your action, you can choose one of your ready units. It moves one quadrant in a cardinal direction to an adjacent friendly quadrant (respecting Leader limits; the destination can be occupied). The unit then becomes exhausted. (See Section III.C.2).  
* **Q:** **How are defensive bonuses calculated?**  
* A: A defending unit's effective Defense is its base Defense plus any modifiers from card effects. Additionally, any unit located in its controller's Back Row receives a \+1 Defense bonus. (See Section III.C.2).  
* **Q: Can I deploy multiple units in the same quadrant?**  
* A: Yes, you can deploy multiple of your units in the same one of your Back Row quadrants, except for Leaders. Only one of your Leaders can occupy one of your quadrants at a time. (See Section IV.A).  
* **Q: Can I target my own units with card abilities or attacks?**  
* A: Yes, if the ability or attack range allows targeting of friendly units, and the unit is a valid target. Combat resolution is identical. (See Section III.C.2, Section VIII \- Targeting, Close Range).  
* **Q: Where can I deploy my Unit cards?**  
* A: All Unit cards must be deployed into a valid quadrant in your Back Row. To move them to the Front Row, you must use a "Move a Unit" action on a subsequent turn in the Activation Sequence. As a general principle, specific card text can override this rule.  
* **Q: What is the difference between Playing an Event and Activating an Event?** **A:** **Playing an Event** is a standard Action you can take only on your turn during the Activation Sequence. **Activating an Event** is a special ability on certain Event cards that allows you to play the card from your hand when a specific trigger condition is met, even during an opponent's turn. Activating an Event adds its effect to the Priority Chain. This can mean becoming the next link on an existing chain (if you are responding to something) or starting an entirely new chain if nothing else is happening.

### **B. Card Clarifications**

* **Q: How do I determine a unit's attack range?**  
* A: The unit's attack range is indicated on its card (Close, Mid, or Far) and defined in the Glossary (Section VIII). This range determines the pool of valid targets.  
* **Q: What happens to an Upgrade attached to a unit that is destroyed?**  
* A: If the unit an Upgrade is attached to is destroyed, the Upgrade is also destroyed and sent to the owner's Discard Pile.  
* **Q: Can Terrain cards be destroyed?**  
* A: Yes, Terrain cards can be destroyed by card abilities or effects that specifically target them.  
* **Q: Can I complete multiple Mission cards in the same Game Round?**  
* A: Yes, you can complete multiple Mission cards in the same Game Round, as long as their conditions are met. Each completed mission grants you powerful one time abilities.  
* **Q: How do I win the game?**  
* A: You win by achieving "Frontline Supremacy." This occurs if, at the end of a round, you have units in all three of your Front Row quadrants AND any of your opponents has no units in any of their Front Row quadrants, that opponent is eliminated. See the updated Section VI for details.  
* Q: How does sideboarding work?  
* A: Between games of a match, you may swap cards between your main deck and a separate 10-card sideboard. The sideboard cannot exceed 40 CP in total value, and all sideboarding must result in a legal 200 CP main deck. For full details, see Section II.D.

## **XIV. Building Your First Deck**

### **A. Core Card Selection**

Start by selecting core cards that represent the foundation of your deck. These cards should be versatile, efficient, and synergize well with each other. Consider a mix of Unit cards for combat, Asset cards for support, and Event cards for tactical flexibility during the Activation Sequence.

### **B. Synergy and Theme**

As you expand your deck, look for cards that complement your core cards and create powerful synergies. This could involve focusing on a specific domain, utilizing cards with shared keywords or abilities, or building around a particular strategy. A well-themed deck with strong synergies will be more consistent and effective than a random collection of cards.

### **C. Testing and Refinement**

Building a successful deck takes time and experimentation. Don't be afraid to test different card combinations, play against various opponents, and analyze your wins and losses. Learn from your experiences and adjust your deck accordingly. The more you play and refine your deck, the better you'll understand the intricacies of Quantum Nexus and develop your own unique playstyle within the alternating activation system.

### **D. Seeking Advice**

The Quantum Nexus community is a valuable resource for new players. Don't hesitate to seek advice from experienced players, browse online forums, and participate in community discussions. You can find decklists, strategy guides, and helpful tips from fellow enthusiasts who are eager to share their knowledge.

Building your first deck is an exciting journey of discovery and self-expression. Embrace the creative process, experiment with different approaches, and most importantly, have fun exploring the vast possibilities that Quantum Nexus has to offer.

## **XV. Tips and Strategies for New Players**

Embarking on your Quantum Nexus journey can be both exciting and overwhelming, especially with the dynamic alternating activation system. Here are some valuable tips and strategies to help you get started and improve your gameplay:

### **A. Early Game Focus**

In the early Game Rounds, focus on establishing board presence by deploying units to your Back Row. Since units must be moved up to the Front Row as a separate action on a later turn, plan your deployments and subsequent actions carefully. Consider deploying units with strong defensive capabilities or useful abilities that function from the Back Row, and plan which units you will spend a future "Move" action on to engage the opponent. Utilizing Terrain in your Back Row can be crucial for protecting newly deployed units.

### **B. Resource Management**

Command Points (CP) are a precious resource, so use them wisely across your actions in a Game Round. Carefully consider which cards to deploy, which abilities to activate, and when to play event cards during your activations. Don't overextend your CP on your first few actions in a round if it leaves you unable to respond with further actions or defend against your opponent's subsequent actions.

### **C. Card Advantage**

Strive to gain card advantage by drawing more cards than your opponent (primarily during the Start of Round Step) or by forcing them to discard cards. Card draw effects, efficient trades during combat (destroying opponent's units or applying states like Suppressed, while preserving your own), and disrupting your opponent's strategy during the Activation Sequence can all contribute to gaining card advantage.

### **D. Adaptability**

Quantum Nexus, with its alternating activations, is a highly dynamic game, and your opponent's strategies will vary. Be prepared to adapt your game plan action by action. If your initial strategy for a Game Round isn't working, don't be afraid to switch tactics or focus on different objectives based on your opponent's moves.

### **E. Mind Games**

Sometimes, the best strategy is to outsmart your opponent. Bluffing (e.g., passing an action when you could still act, to see what your opponent does or to try and secure initiative for the next round), misdirection, and unexpected plays during the Activation Sequence can catch them off guard and create opportunities for you to gain an advantage.

### **F. Learn from Experience**

The best way to improve at Quantum Nexus is to play regularly and learn from your mistakes. Analyze your wins and losses, experiment with different decks and strategies, and seek advice from experienced players. Pay attention to how the alternating action flow impacts your decisions and outcomes.

### **G. Additional Tips**

* **Know Your Deck:** Familiarize yourself with all the cards in your deck, their abilities, and their interactions. This will help you make informed decisions during the fast-paced alternating Activation Sequence.  
* **Watch Your Opponent:** Pay close attention to your opponent's actions and try to anticipate their next move. This will allow you to react effectively and counter their strategies during the back-and-forth of the Activation Sequence.  
* **Have Fun:** Quantum Nexus is a game meant to be enjoyed. Don't get discouraged by losses, and always remember to have fun while playing.

By following these tips and strategies, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled Quantum Nexus player. Remember, practice, experimentation, and a willingness to learn are key to mastering this complex and rewarding game.

## **XVI. Advanced Deck Building Strategies**

Crafting a winning deck involves more than just throwing together powerful cards. Here's how to refine your deck-building prowess:

### **A. Metagame Analysis and Tech Choices**

Stay ahead of the curve by analyzing the current metagame—the popular decks and strategies in the Quantum Nexus community. Identify dominant trends and tailor your deck to counter them.

* **Tech Choices:** These are cards specifically included to address prevalent threats. They might not shine in every match, but they can be the difference-maker against certain decks.

### **B. Curve Optimization**

A well-balanced curve is crucial. It ensures you have plays available at various CP costs, allowing you to make effective use of your CP throughout the Activation Sequence of a Game Round. Aim for a smooth progression of card costs, allowing you to maintain pressure and options.

### **C. Sideboarding**

This is the art of fine-tuning your deck between games in a match. By swapping out specific cards, you can adapt your strategy to better counter your current opponent's deck.

### **D. Deck Archetypes**

Quantum Nexus offers various deck archetypes, each with distinct playstyles:

* **Aggro:** Overwhelm opponents with early aggression and efficient attacks.  
* **Control:** Outlast opponents through disruption, defensive plays, and resource denial.  
* **Combo:** Execute powerful combinations for devastating effects.  
* **Midrange:** Strike a balance between aggression and control, adapting to the flow of the game.

Experiment with different archetypes to find the one that suits your playstyle and the current metagame shaped by the alternating activation system.

### **E. Continuous Improvement**

Deck building is an ongoing journey. The metagame evolves, new cards are released, and your understanding of the game deepens. Continuously test, refine, and adapt your deck based on your experiences and the ever-changing landscape of Quantum Nexus.
