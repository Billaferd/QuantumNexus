# Quantum Nexus: Detailed Rules

## Note to Players

This rulebook is a comprehensive guide to playing Quantum Nexus, providing the foundational rules for the game. While this rulebook aims to be complete, Quantum Nexus is an evolving game. Quantum Nexus is made of many interconnected systems and it may take a while to learn it. There is a Quantum Nexus Quick Start Guide, to ease new players into the game with a limited rule set. When those are understood, we recommend moving on to this rule book for the full experience.

# I. Introduction to Quantum Nexus

## A. Game Overview

Quantum Nexus is an exhilarating sci-fi trading card game that transports players into a world of strategic battles between advanced civilizations. Players build decks of cards representing various units, leaders, and powerful events to outmaneuver their opponents. The game requires strategic thinking, tactical decision-making, and a deep understanding of card interactions to achieve victory. Quantum Nexus can be played by two or more players, with two being the most common configuration. In multiplayer games, players are typically arranged in a circle. A **Game Round** consists of a Start of Round step, followed by an **Activation Sequence** where players take single actions in clockwise order until all pass.
The objective of Quantum Nexus is to defeat your opponent by either:
- Forcing them to draw a card when their deck is empty, or
- Completing all of your mission cards.

## B. Components

To play Quantum Nexus, you will need the following components:
- Cards : These are the heart of the game, representing units, leaders, assets, events, upgrades, terrain, and missions. Each card has unique abilities and characteristics that contribute to your overall strategy.
- Mission Card Area : This designated area is where you place your mission cards face-up at the beginning of the game.
- Deck : This is where you keep your shuffled deck of cards, drawing from it during the Start of Round Step.
- Discard Area : When cards are destroyed or used, they are placed face-up in this area.
- Loadout Area : This area is specifically for Asset cards, which have persistent effects throughout the game.
- Battlefield : This is the main playing area where units are deployed and battles take place. The battlefield is divided into quadrants, each contributing to unit positioning and tactical considerations.

## C. Card Attributes

Each card in Quantum Nexus has several key attributes:
- Command Points (CP) : Located in the top-left corner, CP indicates the cost of playing a card. You have a limited amount of CP each Game Round, so choosing which cards to play is crucial.
- Type : Cards are categorized into types such as Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, Terrain, or Mission. Each type has distinct functions and roles in the game.
- Subtype : Subtypes provide further details about a card, such as its affiliation, or special abilities.
- Rule Box : This section contains the card's abilities, effects, and any special conditions for using it. Understanding the rule box is essential for effective card play.
- Duplicates : Some cards have restrictions on how many copies you can include in your deck. This ensures deck diversity and strategic balance. By familiarizing yourself with these components and card attributes, you'll be well-equipped to embark on your Quantum Nexus journey and build powerful decks to challenge your opponents.

# Quantum Nexus: Core Principles

> * Card Text Overrides Rules: A card's specific text takes precedence over general game rules, unless a rule explicitly states it cannot be overridden (e.g., Section V.F regarding Player Areas and Card Control). If unsure, consult the official FAQ.
> * Precision Matters: Pay close attention to specific keywords and phrases like "target," "destroy," "may," "must," "up to," and "exactly," as they have precise game meanings.
> * Resolve Fully and In Order: Complete each game step and resolve each card effect fully one at a time. Follow the detailed rules for timing and priority, especially for triggered effects (see Section VII.A).
> * Your Space, Your Stuff: A player's cards, tokens, and components always remain in their own designated play areas and are only physically manipulated by their owner (see Section V.F).
> * Paths to Victory: Achieve victory by either completing all of your Mission Cards OR by forcing an opponent to attempt to draw a card when their deck is empty (see Section VI).
> * **Immediate Victory and Loss:** If a condition is met that results in a player winning the game (such as completing all of their Mission Cards) or losing the game (such as being forced to draw a card when their deck is empty), the game ends at that exact moment. This rule takes precedence over all other game actions, abilities, or effects that may be pending or currently resolving. Any unresolved parts of the current game state, including further steps in an action, ongoing ability resolutions, or pending triggered effects, are disregarded, and the game concludes immediately based on the met victory or loss condition.

# II. Deck Construction

**Construction Basics**

In Quantum Nexus, deck construction is a critical aspect of gameplay. Your main deck (excluding Mission Cards) must contain exactly 200 Command Points (CP) worth of cards. This total includes the CP cost of all Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards in your deck. Each such card has a CP value displayed in the top left corner. When selecting these cards for your deck, you must ensure their total CP value adds up to exactly 200. Mission cards do not count towards this 200 CP limit; their CP values contribute to the Command Points calculated at the start of each Game Round (see Section II.B and III.C.1 for details on CP calculation during the Start of Round Step). This restriction ensures balance and prevents players from overwhelming their opponents with too many powerful cards.
Within this 200 CP total, no more than 25 CP may be allocated to cards with the 'Leader' subtype (see Section VII.D).

## A. Deck Size

There is no specific minimum or maximum limit on the number of individual cards in your main deck, provided the total CP of these cards (Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, and Terrain cards) is exactly 200 as detailed in Construction Basics, and you adhere to duplicate limits printed on each card. Mission cards are separated from the main deck at the very beginning of the game setup, before any shuffling for the initial initiative flip occurs (see Section III.A).

## B. Mission Cards

Mission cards play a significant role in Quantum Nexus, representing your objectives during the game. Your deck can include a maximum of six mission cards. These cards not only grant victory points upon completion but also offer passive effects or powerful abilities.
- Total Domain Points : Mission cards are associated with four domains: Technology, Magic, Psionics, and Divinity. The total points across all domains on your mission cards must equal exactly 6. This ensures a diverse set of objectives and prevents focusing on a single domain.
- Single Domain Limit : No single domain on your mission cards can have more than 4 points. This further promotes balance and encourages players to explore different strategies.
- Zero Points Allowed : It is acceptable to have a domain with 0 points on your mission cards. This allows flexibility in deck building and caters to different playstyles.
- Mission-Derived Command Points per Game Round : The total CP value of your chosen mission cards determines a base amount of Command Points (CP) you will calculate during each Game Round's Start of Round Step (see Section III.C.1). For instance, if your mission cards have a combined CP value of 18, this value contributes to your CP calculation at the start of each Game Round.

## C. Unit Cards

Unit cards form the core of your army in Quantum Nexus. They are the ones that engage in combat and fulfill mission objectives. When selecting unit cards for your deck, it's crucial to align them with the domains represented on your mission cards.
- Matching or Lower Domain Values : Unit cards have domain values associated with them (Technology, Magic, Psionics, Divinity). When including a unit card in your deck, its domain value for any given domain (e.g., Technology) must be equal to or lower than the total number of points assigned to that same domain across all of your chosen Mission cards. For instance, if your collective Mission cards grant a total of 3 points in the Technology domain, any Unit card in your deck cannot have more than 3 points in its Technology domain value. If a Unit card has values in multiple domains, this check must be satisfied for each of those domains against the corresponding total from your Mission Cards. Crucially, this means if your Mission cards provide a total of 0 points for a specific domain, you cannot include any Unit card in your deck that has a value greater than 0 in that same domain. There are duplicate limits printed on each card, no card may ever break these limits. They can have an amount of cards lower than the limit, but never higher. By carefully selecting mission cards and aligning your unit cards with their domains, you can create a cohesive and powerful deck that maximizes your chances of victory in Quantum Nexus.

# III. How to Play

## A. Initial Game Setup

Before determining who takes the first action, players prepare for the game:
- Mission Card Placement : Each player identifies their chosen Mission Cards from their constructed deck. These cards are separated from their main deck and placed face-up in that player's Mission Card Area. This makes the objectives visible to all players and ensures Mission Cards are not part of the deck used for the initiative flip.
- Determine Base Mission CP Value : Players determine the base CP value they will derive from their Mission Cards each Game Round. This is done by summing the CP values of their Mission Cards (now in their Mission Card Area). This total is the base CP value derived from Mission Cards for the game and will be used in calculating their Command Point pool during each Start of Round Step (see Section III.C.1).

## B. Initial Game Initiative (First Game Round)

With Mission Cards set aside and base Mission CP value known, the next step is to determine who takes the first action of the first Game Round.
- Prepare Decks : Each player takes their main deck (which now excludes Mission Cards).
- Shuffle : All players thoroughly shuffle their main decks.
- Flip Top Card : Each player simultaneously flips over the top card of their main deck. The CP value of this revealed card (which will be a Unit, Leader, Asset, Event, Upgrade, or Terrain card) is used for comparison.
- Compare CP Values : The player whose revealed card has the lower CP value decides who takes the first action of the first Game Round.
- Tiebreaker : If multiple players reveal cards with the same lowest CP value, or if all players reveal cards with the same CP value, those players involved in the tie continue flipping additional cards from the top of their decks until one player reveals a lower CP value than the others in the tie-breaking flip. Revealed cards from previous tie-breaking flips are set aside by those players until the tie is broken.
- Reshuffle Decks : Once the starting player is decided, all players retrieve any cards revealed during the initiative flip process and thoroughly shuffle them back into their respective decks. This ensures the deck is randomized before the first Game Round begins.

## C. Game Round Structure

A game of Quantum Nexus proceeds in a series of Game Rounds. Each Game Round consists of the following steps:

### 1. Start of Round Step (Simultaneous for all Players)
This step occurs at the beginning of each Game Round and involves the following procedures performed by all players:

  a.  **Simultaneous Refresh Actions:** All players simultaneously perform the following:
      i.  Deactivate all of their previously exhausted cards (returning them to their ready state).
      ii. Gain their Command Points (CP) for the current Game Round. This is done by first resetting their current CP to zero, then summing the total CP value derived from their Mission Cards (as determined during initial game setup) and any additional CP explicitly granted by ongoing card effects or abilities that state they apply "at the start of the round."
      iii. Draw cards until they have five cards in their hand.

  b.  **Resolution of Action-Contingent Triggers:** If any of the actions performed in step (1.a) (such as drawing a card or gaining CP) cause any card abilities to meet their trigger conditions, these triggered abilities now resolve.
      * All such triggered abilities across all players are considered to have triggered simultaneously.
      * They resolve according to the layered trigger resolution rules (Section VII.A). The player who has initiative for the current Game Round (see Section III.D) chooses the order for and resolves all of their own triggered abilities from this step first. Resolution then proceeds clockwise to other players for their abilities triggered in this step.

  c.  **Resolution of "Start of Round" Triggers:** After all abilities triggered by the actions in step (1.b) have fully resolved, any abilities that specifically trigger "at the start of the Game Round" (or "at the start of the round") now resolve.
      * All such triggered abilities across all players are considered to have triggered simultaneously.
      * They also resolve according to the layered trigger resolution rules (Section VII.A). The player who has initiative for the current Game Round chooses the order for and resolves all of their own "start of round" triggered abilities first. Resolution then proceeds clockwise to other players.

  Once all procedures in this "Start of Round Step," including the resolution of all triggered abilities, are complete, the game proceeds to the "Activation Sequence" for the current Game Round.

### 2. Activation Sequence (Alternating Single Actions)
Following the "Start of Round Step," players proceed to the Activation Sequence.

* The player with initiative for the current Game Round (see Section III.D) takes the first single action.
* After that action and any resulting triggered abilities (see Section VII.A) fully resolve, the next player in clockwise order takes a single action.
* This continues, with players alternating taking one action at a time. There is no maximum limit on the amount of CP a player can spend on any single one of these actions during their activation.

**Available Single Actions (Player's Choice):**
When it is a player's turn in the alternating sequence, they may choose **one** of the following actions:

* **Deploy a Card:** Choose one card (Unit, Asset, Terrain, or Upgrade) from their hand and pay its Command Point (CP) cost. Place the card into the appropriate area (Battlefield quadrant for Units/Terrain, Loadout Area for Assets, attached for Upgrades), respecting all placement rules (e.g., Leader limits per quadrant, Terrain limits per quadrant).
* **Activate an Active Ability:** Choose one of their cards in play and one of its Active Abilities. Pay all associated costs (CP, exhausting the card, etc.) as specified by the ability. The ability's effect then resolves. Unless a card's text states otherwise, Active Abilities can be chosen as an action at any point during the Activation Sequence.
* **Declare an Attack:** Choose one of their ready units to declare an attack. The chosen unit becomes exhausted.
    * **Targeting:** The player declares a valid defending enemy unit according to targeting rules (Range definitions in Section VIII, Multiplayer targeting - see below). The Front-Row Priority targeting restriction is REMOVED; players may target any enemy unit in valid range. In multiplayer games, when a player declares an attack, they must also declare which opponent they are targeting. For the purpose of any player's turn, their front row will always face every other player's front row when determining range and targeting against an opponent.
    * **Calculating Defender's Effective Defense:** Before comparing Attack vs. Defense, the defender's effective Defense for this combat is calculated by summing:
        * Its base Defense value.
        * **Universal Terrain Bonus:** +1 Defense for each Terrain card in the defender's own quadrant (maximum +2 Defense from this source). This applies to units in any row. (See Section IV.E for Terrain details).
        * **Additional Back-Row Bonuses (only if the defending unit is in its controller's back row):**
            * +1 Defense if the friendly front-row quadrant directly ahead of it (in the same column) is occupied by a friendly unit.
            * +1 Defense for each Terrain card in the friendly front-row quadrant directly ahead of it (in the same column, maximum +2 Defense from this source).
        * Any other defense modifiers from card effects.
    * **Combat Resolution:** Compare the Attacker's Attack value (A) with the Defender's calculated *Effective Defense value (D)*:
        * **If A > D:** The defending unit is destroyed and sent to its owner's Discard Pile.
        * **If A = D:** The defending unit becomes **"Suppressed."** (A Suppressed unit becomes exhausted. If it was already exhausted, this has no additional immediate effect. It readies as normal during the next Start of Round Step). Both the attacking and defending units survive and remain on the battlefield.
        * **If A < D:** The defending unit survives and is unaffected by this combat. The attacking unit becomes **"Disordered"** (it receives -1 Defense; this state lasts until the start of its controller's next Game Round) AND is **"Pushed Back"** (its controller must move the unit one quadrant in a cardinal direction – Forward, Backward, Left, or Right – to an adjacent friendly quadrant. This chosen quadrant may be occupied by other friendly units, respecting the "one Leader per quadrant" rule. If multiple valid cardinal quadrants are available, the controller chooses. If no such valid quadrant is available, the unit does not move).
* **Play an Event Card:** Choose one Event card from their hand and pay its CP cost. The Event card's effect resolves, and then it is typically placed in the Discard Pile. Unless an Event card's text states otherwise, it can be played as an action at any point during the Activation Sequence.
* **Move a Unit:** Choose one of their ready units. That unit moves one quadrant in a cardinal direction (Forward, Backward, Left, or Right) to an adjacent friendly quadrant. The destination quadrant may be occupied by other friendly units (respecting the "one Leader per quadrant" rule). If multiple valid destination quadrants are available, the controller chooses. If no valid destination quadrant is available, the Move action cannot be taken with that unit. The unit that moved then becomes exhausted as the cost of this action.
* **Pass:** The player chooses to take no other action.

### 3. Ending the Activation Sequence
The Activation Sequence for the Game Round ends when all players, in clockwise order, consecutively "Pass" their action. Once the Activation Sequence ends, the current Game Round is over, and a new Game Round begins with the "Start of Round Step."

## D. Initiative in Game Rounds

Initiative determines which player takes the first action in a Game Round's Activation Sequence.

1.  **Initial Game Initiative (First Game Round):** Determined as described in Section III.B.
2.  **Subsequent Round Initiative (Round 2 onwards):** The player who "passed first" to initiate the final, uninterrupted sequence of passes that ended the *previous* Game Round's Activation Sequence will take the first action in the new Game Round.
3.  **First Action Advantage:** No specific compensation (like extra CP or cards) is given to the player acting second in a Game Round's Activation Sequence. The system for determining initiative and the alternating nature of actions are considered sufficient for balance.

# IV. Card Types

Quantum Nexus boasts a diverse range of card types, each playing a unique role in shaping your strategy and determining the course of battles. Understanding the functions and characteristics of these card types is crucial for mastering the game.

## A. Units

Units are the backbone of your forces in Quantum Nexus. They engage in combat, defend your territory, and complete mission objectives. These cards have both Attack and Defense values, determining their offensive and defensive capabilities in battles. Units are always deployed into and remain within the controlling player's own quadrants on their side of the Battlefield (as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence). A player's units never enter an opponent's quadrants or play area.
- Attack Value : This number, located on the left side of the card, indicates how much damage a unit inflicts when attacking.
- Defense Value : This number, located on the right side of the card, represents how much damage a unit can withstand before being destroyed. Its effective value in combat can be modified by Terrain and other effects (see Section III.C.2).
- Attack Range : Each unit has an attack range (Close, Mid, or Far) that dictates the pool of valid targets it can choose from, which may include quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield or on the attacking player's own side, relative to its current position within its own quadrants. (See Glossary, Section VIII).
- Leaders : Some units are designated as Leaders, possessing enhanced abilities and stats. Only one of a player's Leaders can occupy one of their quadrants at a time; no other Leader controlled by that same player may be moved or deployed into a quadrant that already contains one of their Leaders.
Units may become Leaders, or existing Leaders might have their state altered, through card-specific abilities or effects found in the rule box of cards such as Events, Upgrades, or as part of other card abilities. These are sometimes generally referred to as 'transformation' effects. The specific rules, conditions, and outcomes of such transformations are detailed on the individual cards that enable them. Unless a card's text explicitly overrides general game rules, all standard Leader limitations (e.g., the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule) and the procedures for resolving simultaneous Leader entries into a single quadrant apply when a unit becomes or changes into a Leader due to such a card effect. For instance, if an effect attempts to transform a unit into a Leader in a quadrant already occupied by another of that player's Leaders, and the transforming card does not provide a specific exception, the transformation would fail for that unit in that quadrant according to the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule.
- Resolving Simultaneous Leader Entries : If multiple game effects attempt to simultaneously cause more than one of a single player's Leader units to enter or exist in the same quadrant (through deployment, movement, or transformation), the following occurs: The player whose current action or resolving effect is causing the entries (or the player with initiative for the Game Round in the case of simultaneous Start of Round triggers) determines the order in which these simultaneous effects attempt to resolve.
    - For each effect in sequence: If resolving it would result in more than one of that player's Leaders being in the target quadrant, that specific effect fails, and the Leader is not deployed, moved, or transformed.
    - If an effect successfully places a Leader, and this now means a subsequent simultaneous effect (if it were to resolve) would cause a violation, that subsequent effect will fail when its turn comes to be considered.
    - In essence, once a Leader successfully occupies a quadrant, no other Leader controlled by the same player can enter that quadrant as part of the same batch of simultaneous effects, even if another effect in that batch would subsequently move the first Leader out. The 'one Leader per quadrant' rule is checked at the point each individual simultaneous effect attempts to resolve. (Deck construction limits for Leaders are in Section II and Section VII.D).
    It's important to note how this interacts with the general resolution of triggered abilities (Section VII.A) when multiple distinct effects are involved: If several different triggered effects (which are resolving according to the layered process described in Section VII.A) would each independently lead to simultaneous attempts for more than one of a single player's units to enter or exist as a Leader in the same quadrant, the overall order in which those distinct effects attempt to resolve **is governed by Section VII.A**. When the resolution of any individual effect (or a single effect with multiple such consequences) prompts a situation where that player's units would simultaneously attempt to become Leaders, the player controlling those units and the quadrant then applies the rules detailed above in this section: they choose the order for their own units' entry attempts, and each attempt **is validated against the 'one Leader per quadrant' rule** at its point of attempted resolution.

## B. Assets

Assets are persistent cards that remain in the controlling player's Loadout Area throughout the game, providing ongoing benefits or activating special abilities. They are deployed as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence. They differ from Units in that they have a Defense value but no Attack value. Assets inherently cannot declare an Attack (Action), as this action is exclusive to Units. If an Upgrade or other card effect grants an Attack value to an Asset, this Attack value may be referenced by other card abilities or effects (e.g., 'Destroy an Asset with an Attack value of X or more'), but it does not grant the Asset the ability to perform an Attack (Action) itself. Assets primarily influence the game through their printed abilities and persistent effects from the Loadout Area, not through direct combat participation as attackers.
- Defense Value : Similar to Units, Assets have a Defense value that determines how much damage they can withstand.
- Loadout Area : Unlike Units, Assets are not deployed onto the battlefield but are instead placed in the controlling player's Loadout Area. This protects them from direct attacks by enemy units.
- Activation : Asset Active Abilities can be chosen as an 'Activate an Active Ability' action during the Activation Sequence, granting various effects such as boosting friendly units, hindering opponents, or manipulating the battlefield.
- Persistent Effects : Some Assets provide continuous passive effects that influence the game state for as long as they remain in play.

## C. Events

Event cards are powerful tools that can significantly impact the course of a game. These cards are played from hand as a 'Play an Event Card' action during the Activation Sequence and offer one-time effects before being discarded to the owner's Discard Pile. Unless an Event card's text specifies otherwise, it can be played at any point during the Activation Sequence when a player is taking an action.
- One-Time Use : Unlike Units and Assets, Events are not persistent and are discarded immediately after their effect resolves.
- Powerful Effects : Events can range from dealing direct damage to units, manipulating card positions, or granting temporary bonuses. Their strategic use can turn the tide of battle.

## D. Upgrades

Upgrades are cards that modify other cards on the battlefield, enhancing their abilities or granting them new ones. They are deployed as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence. These cards typically attach to a player's own Units or Assets and remain in play as long as the modified card does.
- Modifying Attack and Defense : Upgrades can increase or decrease the Attack and Defense values of the attached card, making them stronger or weaker in combat.
- Additional Effects : Many Upgrades grant additional abilities or effects to the attached card, expanding its tactical potential.

## E. Terrain

Terrain cards represent different environments on the battlefield and affect the units within specific quadrants. These cards are deployed as a 'Deploy a Card' action during the Activation Sequence into a player's own quadrants on their side of the Battlefield and remain in play until removed by a card effect. A player may only deploy Terrain cards into any of the quadrants on their own side of the Battlefield.
- **Universal Defense Bonus:** All Terrain cards inherently provide +1 Defense to any unit located in the same quadrant as the Terrain card. This bonus applies whenever the unit's Defense value is used, read, or referenced. If two Terrain cards are active in the same quadrant, units in that quadrant gain +2 Defense from this universal effect. This inherent Defense bonus is in addition to any other abilities printed in the Terrain card's rule box text. (See Section III.C.2 for how this contributes to a unit's effective Defense in combat, including additional bonuses for back-row units from Terrain in the quadrant ahead of them).
- Quadrant Effects : Each Terrain card also applies any passive effect described in its rule box to all units (friendly or enemy, if an enemy unit is targeting into or being affected within that quadrant from afar, as units never co-occupy opponent's quadrants) located in the specific quadrant on the owning player's side of the Battlefield where the Terrain is active. These effects can range from further stat bonuses to special abilities or restrictions.
- Limited Placement : A player can have a maximum of two of their own Terrain cards active in any single one of their quadrants at any given time. For example, Player A can have up to two Terrain cards in their Front Left quadrant; this does not affect how many Terrain cards Player B can have in Player B's Front Left quadrant.
- Stacking Terrain Effects : If two Terrain cards are active in the same quadrant, their effects (including the universal +1 Defense from each, and their printed rule box effects) are cumulative unless specified otherwise on the cards. If Terrain effects provide numerical modifiers (e.g., one grants "+1 Attack" and another grants "-1 Attack" to the same units), these numerical modifiers are combined (e.g., +1 and -1 result in a net +0). If a non-numerical effect from a Terrain card active in a quadrant explicitly negates, prevents, or forbids an action, state, or condition that another non-numerical effect active in or targeting that same quadrant (whether from another Terrain card, a Unit ability, an Event card, or any other game source) explicitly permits, enables, or creates, and the rules do not specify a hierarchy (e.g., 'card effects override game rules'), then neither of those specific, directly conflicting effects is applied.
> A note on the 'neither applies' rule for conflicting non-numerical effects: This resolution is a specific design choice. It aims to provide a clear outcome when two powerful, opposing states would otherwise create ambiguity (e.g., an effect stating a unit 'cannot use abilities' and another stating the same unit 'may use an additional ability'). Instead of establishing a complex hierarchy of which effect type always 'wins,' this rule neutralizes the directly opposing parts of such effects. This encourages players to be strategically aware of how their persistent effects interact and prevents certain combinations from unintentionally dominating the game state. Other, non-conflicting effects from the involved cards still apply. As always, if the nature of a conflict remains unclear, consult card-specific rulings or the official FAQ.
Card-specific rulings or the official FAQ should be consulted if the nature of a conflict remains unclear.

# V. Areas of Play

Quantum Nexus utilizes several distinct areas where cards are played and interacted with. Understanding these areas and their functions is essential for smooth gameplay and strategic decision-making.

## A. Mission Card Area

Located prominently above the playing area, the Mission Card Area is where players place their chosen mission cards face-up at the beginning of the game from their own deck. This area serves two primary purposes:
- Visibility : By placing mission cards face-up, all players can easily see each other's objectives. This transparency ensures fairness and allows players to strategize accordingly.
- Reference : Throughout the game, players can refer to their mission cards to track their progress and plan their actions. Completing mission objectives is a key victory condition in Quantum Nexus.

## B. Deck

The Deck is the heart of each player's arsenal, containing their carefully constructed collection of cards (excluding Mission Cards after initial setup).
- Starting Point : At the beginning of the game, after Mission Cards are removed and after the initiative flip and subsequent reshuffle, each player's main deck is placed face-down in their designated Deck area.
- Drawing Cards : During the Start of Round Step, players draw cards from their own deck to replenish their hand and gain access to new options.
- Deck Depletion : If a player is unable to draw a card when required, they lose the game. This emphasizes the importance of managing your deck and resources effectively.

## C. Discard Pile

The Discard Pile serves as a repository for cards that are no longer in play from that player's hand, deck, or their side of the battlefield/loadout area.
- Discarding Cards : Cards are sent to their owner's Discard Pile when they are destroyed in battle, used for their effects, or discarded due to other game mechanics.
- Face-Up Placement : Discarded cards are placed face-up in the owner's Discard Pile, allowing all players to see which cards have been used or eliminated.

## D. Loadout Area

The Loadout Area is a designated space for each player's Asset cards.
- Asset Placement : When Asset cards are played from a player's hand, they are not placed on the battlefield like Units. Instead, they are placed face-up in the owner's Loadout Area.
- Protection : Assets in the Loadout Area are immune to direct attacks from enemy units, offering a degree of protection. However, they can still be targeted by certain card abilities or effects.
- Ongoing Effects : Assets typically provide continuous benefits or activate powerful abilities, making them valuable strategic assets.

## E. Battlefield

The Battlefield is the central arena where Units are deployed and battles unfold. It is divided into distinct zones for each player.
- Quadrants : The Battlefield for each player consists of six quadrants: Front Left, Front Center, Front Right (collectively the 'Front Row' of quadrants), and Back Left, Back Center, Back Right (collectively the 'Back Row' of quadrants). These quadrants dictate unit positioning within a player's own area and their potential attack ranges against opponents or even their own units. For precise definitions of directional terms used to describe movement and targeting on the battlefield, refer to the 'Directional Terms on the Battlefield' section in the Glossary (Section VIII).
- Front Row and Back Row : The terms 'Front Row' and 'Back Row' refer to these collective sets of quadrants. Their primary relevance to combat defense is now through the positional defense bonus system (see Section III.C.2).
- Flanks and Center : The Battlefield is also considered in terms of columns (Left, Center, Right) often referred to as flanks (Left, Right) and Center. These offer strategic options for unit placement and movement within a player's own side.
- Attack Range : Each Unit card has a designated attack range (Close, Mid, or Far) that determines the pool of valid targets from which it can choose a defender. This pool may include quadrants on an opponent's side of the battlefield or, in some cases, quadrants on the attacking player's own side, depending on the unit's current position within its owner's quadrants. (See Glossary, Section VIII).

## F. Player Areas and Card Control

Each player controls their own set of Battlefield quadrants (Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Back Left, Back Center, Back Right), their Mission Card Area, their Deck, their Discard Pile, and their Loadout Area. Unless a card effect or game rule specifically states otherwise, players may only deploy, move, or place their cards and effects into their own areas of play. A player's cards will never leave their own play area (Battlefield quadrants, Loadout Area, Discard Pile, Deck, Hand, Mission Card Area) to enter an opponent's play area. Players may not physically move, touch, or otherwise manipulate cards or components within an opponent's designated play areas, except when an opponent's card is destroyed as a result of gameplay and is then moved by its owner to their own Discard Pile. This rule is absolute: Never will a player touch another player's card for any other reason. No card effect will ever break this rule; it is forbidden by design. Any card effect that results in an opponent's card changing zones, being modified, or otherwise affected must be physically carried out by the card's owner, even if the decision or targeting is made by the player activating the effect.

# VI. Winning the Game

In Quantum Nexus, victory can be achieved through two distinct paths, each requiring different strategic approaches and tactical execution.

## A. Emptying Opponent's Deck

The first and most direct path to victory is to force an opponent to draw a card when their deck is empty. If a player is unable to draw a card when required (typically during the Start of Round Step), they immediately lose the game and are eliminated. This applies even if multiple players are forced to draw simultaneously and cannot. There are no draw conditions related to deck out; players are individually eliminated until only one winner remains or all players have been eliminated. If all players are eliminated, there is no winner. This can be accomplished through various means, such as:
- Aggressive Attacks : Continuously attacking and destroying an opponent's units will gradually deplete their deck. By focusing on offensive strategies and overpowering their defenses, you can push them closer to defeat.
- Discard Effects : Some cards possess abilities that force opponents to discard cards from their deck. Utilizing these effects strategically can accelerate their deck depletion and bring you closer to victory.
- Deck Manipulation : Certain cards and abilities allow you to manipulate an opponent's deck, potentially burying key cards or disrupting their strategy. This indirect approach can weaken their options and increase the likelihood of them running out of cards.

## B. Completing Mission Cards

The second path to victory involves completing all of your mission cards. Each mission card presents specific objectives that, when fulfilled, grant you victory points and potentially powerful rewards. If a player completes all of their mission cards, they immediately win the game. If multiple players simultaneously meet the conditions for completing all of their respective mission cards (e.g., as a result of the same triggered effect or chain of effects resolving), all such players are declared winners. The game concludes, and all these players share the victory.
- Diverse Objectives : Mission cards encompass a variety of objectives, ranging from controlling specific quadrants on the battlefield to deploying certain unit types or achieving specific combat feats.
- Passive Effects : Many mission cards provide passive effects that benefit your forces or hinder your opponent upon completion. These effects can significantly impact the game's momentum.
- Powerful Abilities : Some mission cards grant powerful one-time abilities upon completion, such as dealing massive damage, drawing additional cards, or manipulating the battlefield.
- Strategic Planning : To achieve victory through mission completion, careful planning is essential. You must prioritize which missions to pursue and tailor your strategy accordingly. By understanding these two paths to victory, you can adapt your approach based on the composition of your deck, your opponent's strategy, and the evolving game state. Whether you choose to focus on aggressive deck depletion or methodical mission completion, Quantum Nexus offers a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

## C. Immediacy of Victory
(This is the wording for the new Core Principle, placed here for reinforcement).
When a condition that results in a player winning or losing the game is met (such as completing all of their Mission Cards or being unable to draw a card from an empty deck), the game ends at that exact moment. This rule takes precedence over all other game actions, abilities, or effects that may be pending or currently resolving. Any unresolved parts of the current game state, including further steps in an action, ongoing ability resolutions, or pending triggered effects, are disregarded, and the game concludes immediately based on the met victory or loss condition.

# VII. Additional Rules and Clarifications

## A. Card Interactions

Quantum Nexus features a dynamic interplay between different card types and abilities. Understanding how cards interact is crucial for making informed decisions and maximizing your strategic potential.
- Targeting : "Targeting" refers to how a card's range or ability defines a pool of valid targets. Some card abilities allow you to target specific card types, subtypes, or locations on an opponent's battlefield, or specific cards they control, or even your own cards or quadrants. Pay close attention to the wording of each ability and range definition to determine its valid targets. An "attack" then involves selecting one specific, valid target from this pool to be the defender.
- Triggered Abilities : Many cards possess triggered abilities that activate in response to specific events, such as deploying a unit, attacking, or being attacked. These abilities can create powerful chain reactions and turn the tide of battle. It is important to remember that all triggered abilities, including Interrupts, only activate when their specific conditions are met, as detailed on the card or in the rules. Card text is paramount in determining when and how these abilities trigger and resolve.
- Mandatory and Optional Interrupts : Some abilities are mandatory interrupts, meaning they must be activated if their trigger condition is met. Others are optional interrupts, giving you the choice to activate them by paying a specified cost.
- Stacking Effects : Multiple card effects can interact and stack with each other. Understanding the order in which effects resolve and how they modify each other is essential for accurate gameplay.
- Resolution Order for Triggered Abilities and Effects : When a player's action or another game event causes multiple card abilities or effects to trigger simultaneously, they resolve using the following layered process:
    - Initial Triggers (First Layer)
        1.  "Priority Player" Resolves First: The player whose action caused the initial triggers (or the player with initiative for the Game Round in the case of simultaneous "Start of Round" triggers originating from step 1.c of the Start of Round Step, or action-contingent triggers from step 1.b of the Start of Round Step) first gathers all of their own abilities and effects that have triggered from that specific action/event.
        2.  This "priority player" then chooses the order in which these effects will resolve and resolves all of them completely.
        3.  Other Players Resolve (Clockwise): After the "priority player" has resolved all their triggered abilities and effects, the next player in turn order (clockwise) gathers all of their own abilities and effects that triggered from the same initial action or event.
        4.  That player chooses the order for their effects and resolves all of them completely.
        5.  This process (steps 3-4) continues clockwise until all players have resolved their abilities and effects that were triggered by the initial action or event.
    - Newly Triggered Effects (Subsequent Layers)
        6.  Identify New Triggers: If resolving any effects in the current layer (e.g., Layer 1) causes new abilities or effects to trigger, these new triggers are momentarily set aside. They will form the next layer of effects to be resolved.
        7.  Complete Current Layer First: The next layer of triggers is addressed only after all effects from the current layer have finished resolving for all players.
        8.  Resolve Next Layer: Once the current layer is complete, address the set-aside new triggers as follows:
            a.  For each effect in the previous layer that caused one or more new triggers, the player who controlled that causing effect becomes the 'priority player' for the specific triggers it generated.
            b.  The 'priority player' gathers all abilities they control that were triggered by their specific causing effect, chooses the order for them to resolve, and resolves all of them completely.
            c.  Then, proceeding clockwise from the 'priority player,' any other players resolve any of their abilities that were triggered by that same specific causing effect, in an order of their choosing for their own effects.
            d.  If multiple different effects in the previous layer caused distinct sets of new triggers, repeat steps 8a-8c for each set. The order in which these sets are addressed follows the order in which their causing effects resolved in the previous layer.
        9.  Repeat Process: This process of resolving a layer, identifying new triggers, and then resolving the subsequent layer continues until a layer resolves completely with no new abilities triggering. After all triggered abilities and effects from a player's action have resolved, the next player in the Activation Sequence may take their action.

(Original Example of Layered Trigger Resolution and its diagram are removed, as they were tied to the old example; a new example specific to alternating activations would be beneficial but is not generated here).

- Invalid Targets or Conditions Upon Resolution : If all mandatory targets for a triggered ability or effect are no longer legal or valid when that ability or effect resolves (due to other effects that resolved earlier, for example), the ability or effect fails to resolve and does nothing (it "fizzles"). If an effect has multiple targets or actions, and only some become invalid, the effect resolves as much as possible for the remaining valid targets or actions.

## B. Changing the Order of Play (Initiative Summary)
This section is REMOVED as its content is replaced by Section III.D "Initiative in Game Rounds."

## C. Ending the Game
This section is REMOVED as its content is covered by Section VI "Winning the Game" and the Core Principle on "Immediate Victory and Loss."

## D. Card Type Counts (Leader Limit)
Each deck can't have any more then 25 CP worth of Leader Unit cards. This 25 CP is part of the overall 200 CP limit for the main deck. Each card type has very specific strengths and weaknesses that can only be balanced with a thought-out and diverse army. (This rule is unchanged and remains).

# VIII. Glossary of Terms

To help you fully grasp the intricacies of Quantum Nexus, here is a glossary of essential terms used throughout the game:

### Directional Terms on the Battlefield
(This section remains crucial and unchanged).
- Forward:
    - Within a Player's Own Side: The direction from a unit's current quadrant in their Back Row towards the quadrant in the same column in their own Front Row.
    - Towards an Opponent's Side: The direction from a unit's current quadrant (typically in the active player's Front Row) towards the corresponding quadrant (same column) in a declared opponent's Front Row.
    - General Principle: "Forward" always indicates movement or orientation away from the active player's board edge and towards an opponent's side, or from a player's Back Row towards their Front Row.
    - Multiplayer Context: In multiplayer games, "Forward" is always oriented towards the specific opponent who has been declared as the target for the current action or effect. This aligns with the rule (Section III.C.2) that a player's Front Row is considered to be facing the declared opponent's Front Row for targeting purposes.
- Backward:
    - Within a Player's Own Side: The direction from a unit's current quadrant in their Front Row towards the quadrant in the same column in their own Back Row.
    - General Principle: "Backward" always indicates movement or orientation away from the opponent's side and towards the active player's own board edge, or from a player's Front Row towards their Back Row.
    - A unit cannot target, move, or have its position referenced "Backward" off the playable area of its controller's side of the battlefield.
- Left:
    - The direction from a unit's current quadrant to an existing, horizontally adjacent quadrant towards the active player's left-hand side, typically within the same row (Front or Back Row).
- Right:
    - The direction from a unit's current quadrant to an existing, horizontally adjacent quadrant towards the active player's right-hand side, typically within the same row (Front or Back Row).
- Diagonal Directions:
    - These are compound directions derived from the cardinal directions. For example:
        - Forward-Left: The quadrant that is one step Forward and one step Left from the point of origin.
        - Backward-Right: The quadrant that is one step Backward and one step Right from the point of origin.
    - All component directions of a diagonal movement or reference must correspond to existing quadrants on the battlefield to be valid.

- **Action (Player):** During the Activation Sequence of a Game Round, when it is their turn, a player chooses to perform one Action. Available Actions are: Deploy a Card, Activate an Active Ability, Declare an Attack, Play an Event Card, Move a Unit, or Pass.
- **Activate:** To choose to use a card's Active Ability as an Action, paying its costs. Also refers to the process of resolving Interrupts.
- **Active Ability:** An ability identified in a card's rule box that a player must consciously choose to use as their Action during the Activation Sequence. Activating it usually requires paying costs (like CP) and often requires exhausting the card. Unless a card's text specifies other timing restrictions, Active Abilities can be used at any point during the Activation Sequence when a player takes an Action. Passive Abilities are not "activated" in this way.
- **Activation Sequence:** The main part of a Game Round where players take turns performing single Actions in clockwise order until all players consecutively Pass.
- **Asset:** A card type that can be deployed into the controlling player's loadout area. Deploying an Asset is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.
- **Attack (Action):** See 'Declare an Attack.'
- **Attack Value (A):** This number represents the unit's offensive strength. Used in combat resolution (see Section III.C.2).
- **Battlefield:** The central playing area where units are deployed and battles take place.
- **Close Range:** A unit with a Close Range attack or ability can target its own current quadrant AND one existing quadrant directly Forward, Backward, Left, and Right of its current quadrant. This results in targeting up to 5 quadrants. A unit declaring an attack with Close Range may target its own unit in its own quadrant.
- **Command Points (CP):** A resource used to deploy cards and activate abilities. Players gain CP during the Start of Round Step.
- **Deactivate:** The action of returning an exhausted card to its ready (upright) state, performed during the Start of Round Step.
- **Declare an Attack:** An Action a player can take with one of their ready units. The unit exhausts. Combat resolution follows (see Section III.C.2), resulting in potential destruction, or the defender being Suppressed, or the attacker being Disordered and Pushed Back.
- **Deck:** A player's collection of cards from which they draw during the Start of Round Step.
- **Defense Value (D):** This number represents a unit's resilience. Its effective value in combat is calculated as described in Section III.C.2.
- **Disordered (State):** A state applied to an attacking unit if its Attack is less than the defender's effective Defense during combat. A Disordered unit has -1 to its Defense value. This state lasts until the start of its controller's next Game Round.
- **Domain:** A thematic category associated with mission cards and unit cards.
- **Event:** A card type that provides a one-time effect when played from hand as an Action during the Activation Sequence.
- **Exhaust:** To turn a card sideways from its ready position. Required for Declaring an Attack, Moving a Unit, or using certain Active Abilities. Exhausted cards are deactivated during the Start of Round Step.
- **Far Range:** An attack range allowing a unit to target all quadrants located exactly two rows ahead of its current row, on an opponent's side of the battlefield. Units in a player's Front Row target all quadrants in the opponent's Back Row. Units in a player's Back Row target all quadrants in the opponent's Front Row. Far Range does not include the attacking unit's own current quadrant.
- **Flank:** The left and right columns of quadrants on a player's side of the battlefield.
- **Friendly Unit:** A unit controlled by the same player.
- **Front Row:** The row of three quadrants on a player's side of the battlefield closest to the opposing side(s). Does not inherently prevent targeting of back-row units.
- **Game Round:** The main cycle of play. Consists of a "Start of Round Step" and an "Activation Sequence."
- **Initiative:** Determines which player takes the first Action in a Game Round's Activation Sequence. See Section III.B for initial game initiative and Section III.D for subsequent round initiative.
- **Interrupt:** A card ability that triggers in response to a specific event. Resolving an Interrupt pauses the Activation Sequence.
- **Leader:** A powerful unit card with deployment restrictions (one per quadrant, deck limits).
- **Loadout Area:** A designated area for Asset cards.
- **Mid Range:** A unit with a Mid Range attack or ability can target one existing quadrant directly Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Forward-Left Diagonal, Forward-Right Diagonal, Backward-Left Diagonal, and Backward-Right Diagonal from its current quadrant. Mid Range does not include the attacking unit's own current quadrant.
- **Mission Card:** A card representing an objective.
- **Move (Action):** An Action a player can take with one of their ready units. The unit moves one quadrant in a cardinal direction to an adjacent friendly quadrant (respecting Leader limits; destination can be occupied by other friendly non-Leaders). The unit then becomes exhausted.
- **Opposing Unit:** A unit controlled by an opponent.
- **Passive Ability:** An ability that is always active and does not require being chosen as an Action to use. Unless specified otherwise by an effect, Passive Abilities remain active even if a unit is Suppressed.
- **Pushed Back (Mechanic):** A forced movement effect applied to an attacking unit if its Attack is less than the defender's effective Defense. Its controller moves the unit one friendly cardinal quadrant away (respecting Leader limits). If no valid move, it doesn't move.
- **Quadrant:** One of the six sections of a player's side of the battlefield.
- **Ready:** The normal, upright orientation of a card.
- **Rule Box:** The section of a card that details its abilities.
- **Start of Round Step:** The first step of each Game Round (see Section III.C.1).
- **Subtype:** A more specific classification of a card's type.
- **Suppressed (State):** A state applied to a defending unit if its effective Defense equals the attacker's Attack. A Suppressed unit becomes exhausted. If it was already exhausted, this has no additional immediate effect. It readies as normal during the next Start of Round Step.
- **Targeting:** The process by which a card's range or ability defines a pool of valid targets.
- **Terrain:** A card type deployed into an owner's quadrant. All Terrain cards inherently provide +1 Defense to units in their quadrant (stacking to +2D if two are present), in addition to their printed rule box effects. See Section IV.E and III.C.2. Deploying Terrain is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.
- **Triggered Ability:** An ability that activates automatically when a specific condition is met.
- **Unit:** A card type representing characters or vehicles. Deploying a Unit is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.
- **Upgrade:** A card type that modifies another card. Deploying an Upgrade is a 'Deploy a Card' Action.
- Note on Ranges : (This note remains relevant).

# IX. Advanced Gameplay Concepts

## A. Resource Management and Tempo

Command Points (CP) are your lifeblood. Mastering their use is key to victory. Prioritize which cards to deploy or abilities to activate as your action during the Activation Sequence based on the game's flow and your strategic goals.
- Tempo : This refers to the pace at which you utilize your CP and actions within a Game Round's alternating Activation Sequence. A well-timed action can disrupt your opponent's plans or seize an advantage. Overspending CP on early actions in a round may leave you with fewer options for your subsequent actions in that same round. Strive for a balance that maintains pressure while leaving resources for adapting to the unexpected.

## B. Card Advantage and Board Control

In Quantum Nexus, numbers matter. Card advantage, having more resources than your opponent, can be achieved through:
- Efficient Trades : Destroy enemy units (or apply tactical states like Suppressed or Disordered) while minimizing your own losses or resource expenditure.
- Card Draw Effects : Utilize cards that let you draw additional cards, expanding your options.
- Disruption : Force your opponent to discard cards or waste resources/actions. Controlling the battlefield (board control) goes hand-in-hand with card advantage. Strategic unit placement within your own quadrants, tactical movement, and utilizing terrain for defensive bonuses can limit your opponent's options and give you the upper hand.

## C. Adapting to Your Opponent

Every opponent brings a unique deck and strategy. Stay observant, analyze their choices during the alternating Activation Sequence, and adapt your tactics action by action to counter their approach. Flexibility is key; don't be afraid to shift your game plan if your initial strategy falters.

## D. Psychological Warfare

Sometimes, the most potent weapon is your opponent's mind. Calculated bluffs (e.g., passing an action despite having CP), misdirection, and unexpected plays during the Activation Sequence can create openings and sow doubt.

# X. Variants and Expansions

# XIII. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

(This section requires significant updates. Old phase-dependent questions are obsolete. New questions will arise from the new system. Placeholders for new FAQs are provided below).

## A. Gameplay Questions

- Q: How is the first player to act in a Game Round determined?
- A: For the first Game Round, players flip the top card of their deck; the player revealing the lower CP card decides who acts first. For subsequent Game Rounds, the player who passed first to end the previous round's Activation Sequence acts first. (See Section III.B and III.D).
- Q: What actions can I take during my activation in the Activation Sequence?
- A: You can choose one of the following: Deploy a Card, Activate an Active Ability, Declare an Attack, Play an Event Card, Move a Unit, or Pass. (See Section III.C.2).
- Q: What happens if a unit's Attack (A) equals a defender's effective Defense (D) in battle?
- A: The defending unit becomes "Suppressed" (it becomes exhausted). Both units survive. (See Section III.C.2).
- Q: What happens if an attacker's Attack (A) is less than a defender's effective Defense (D) in battle?
- A: The attacker becomes "Disordered" (-1 Defense until its next Start of Round Step) and is "Pushed Back" (moved one friendly cardinal quadrant by its controller). The defender is unaffected. (See Section III.C.2).
- Q: Can I play Event cards or use Active Abilities at any time?
- A: You can play an Event card or use an Active Ability as your chosen action during your turn in the Activation Sequence, assuming you can pay all costs and meet any conditions on the card. There are no general restrictions based on former game phases, but individual cards may have specific timing requirements in their text. (See Section III.C.2).
- Q: Can I target units in an opponent's back row with a direct attack even if there are units in their front row?
- A: Yes. The previous Front-Row Priority targeting restriction has been removed. You can target any enemy unit that is within your attacking unit's valid range. Back-row units may have additional defensive bonuses based on friendly units or Terrain in front of them. (See Section III.C.2).
- Q: How does the "Move" action work?
- A: As your action, you can choose one of your ready units. It moves one quadrant in a cardinal direction to an adjacent friendly quadrant (respecting Leader limits; the destination can be occupied). The unit then becomes exhausted. (See Section III.C.2).
- Q: How do defensive bonuses from Terrain work?
- A: All Terrain cards inherently give +1 Defense to units in their quadrant (stacking to +2D if two Terrain cards are in the same quadrant). Additionally, back-row units get +1D if a friendly unit is in the front-row quadrant directly ahead, and +1D for each Terrain in that front-row quadrant ahead. (See Section IV.E and III.C.2).
- Q: Can I deploy multiple units in the same quadrant?
- A: Yes, you can deploy multiple of your units in the same one of your quadrants, except for Leaders. Only one of your Leaders can occupy one of your quadrants at a time. (See Section IV.A).
- Q: Can I target my own units with card abilities or attacks?
- A: Yes, if the ability or attack range allows targeting of friendly units, and the unit is a valid target. Combat resolution is identical. (See Section III.C.2, Section VIII - Targeting, Close Range).

## B. Card Clarifications

- Q: How do I determine a unit's attack range?
- A: The unit's attack range is indicated on its card (Close, Mid, or Far) and defined in the Glossary (Section VIII). This range determines the pool of valid targets.
- Q: What happens to an Upgrade attached to a unit that is destroyed?
- A: If the unit an Upgrade is attached to is destroyed, the Upgrade is also destroyed and sent to the owner's Discard Pile.
- Q: Can Terrain cards be destroyed?
- A: Yes, Terrain cards can be destroyed by card abilities or effects that specifically target them.
- Q: Can I complete multiple mission cards in the same Game Round?
- A: Yes, you can complete multiple mission cards in the same Game Round, as long as their conditions are met. Victory is immediate upon completing all missions.

# XIV. Building Your First Deck

(Original text of this section is largely retained as its advice on core selection, synergy, testing, and seeking advice is generally applicable, though the strategic context changes with the new rules).

## A. Core Card Selection
Start by selecting core cards that represent the foundation of your deck. These cards should be versatile, efficient, and synergize well with each other. Consider a mix of unit cards for combat, asset cards for support, and event cards for tactical flexibility during the Activation Sequence.

## B. Synergy and Theme
As you expand your deck, look for cards that complement your core cards and create powerful synergies. This could involve focusing on a specific domain, utilizing cards with shared keywords or abilities, or building around a particular strategy. A well-themed deck with strong synergies will be more consistent and effective than a random collection of cards.

## C. Testing and Refinement
Building a successful deck takes time and experimentation. Don't be afraid to test different card combinations, play against various opponents, and analyze your wins and losses. Learn from your experiences and adjust your deck accordingly. The more you play and refine your deck, the better you'll understand the intricacies of Quantum Nexus and develop your own unique playstyle within the alternating activation system.

## D. Seeking Advice
The Quantum Nexus community is a valuable resource for new players. Don't hesitate to seek advice from experienced players, browse online forums, and participate in community discussions. You can find decklists, strategy guides, and helpful tips from fellow enthusiasts who are eager to share their knowledge.
Building your first deck is an exciting journey of discovery and self-expression. Embrace the creative process, experiment with different approaches, and most importantly, have fun exploring the vast possibilities that Quantum Nexus has to offer.

# XV. Tips and Strategies for New Players

Embarking on your Quantum Nexus journey can be both exciting and overwhelming, especially with the dynamic alternating activation system. Here are some valuable tips and strategies to help you get started and improve your gameplay:

## A. Early Game Focus

In the early Game Rounds, focus on establishing board presence within your quadrants using your initial actions in the Activation Sequence. Deploy units with strong early-game potential, such as those with low CP costs or abilities that benefit from early deployment. Aim to control key quadrants and utilize Terrain to your advantage for defense. Think about how each action might be responded to by your opponent.

## B. Resource Management

Command Points (CP) are a precious resource, so use them wisely across your actions in a Game Round. Carefully consider which cards to deploy, which abilities to activate, and when to play event cards during your activations. Don't overextend your CP on your first few actions in a round if it leaves you unable to respond with further actions or defend against your opponent's subsequent actions.

## C. Card Advantage

Strive to gain card advantage by drawing more cards than your opponent (primarily during the Start of Round Step) or by forcing them to discard cards. Card draw effects, efficient trades during combat (destroying opponent's units or applying states like Suppressed or Disordered while preserving your own), and disrupting your opponent's strategy during the Activation Sequence can all contribute to gaining card advantage.

## D. Adaptability

Quantum Nexus, with its alternating activations, is a highly dynamic game, and your opponent's strategies will vary. Be prepared to adapt your game plan action by action. If your initial strategy for a Game Round isn't working, don't be afraid to switch tactics or focus on different objectives based on your opponent's moves.

## E. Mind Games

Sometimes, the best strategy is to outsmart your opponent. Bluffing (e.g., passing an action when you could still act, to see what your opponent does or to try and secure initiative for the next round), misdirection, and unexpected plays during the Activation Sequence can catch them off guard and create opportunities for you to gain an advantage.

## F. Learn from Experience

The best way to improve at Quantum Nexus is to play regularly and learn from your mistakes. Analyze your wins and losses, experiment with different decks and strategies, and seek advice from experienced players. Pay attention to how the alternating action flow impacts your decisions and outcomes.

## G. Additional Tips

- Know Your Deck : Familiarize yourself with all the cards in your deck, their abilities, and their interactions. This will help you make informed decisions during the fast-paced alternating Activation Sequence.
- Watch Your Opponent : Pay close attention to your opponent's actions and try to anticipate their next move. This will allow you to react effectively and counter their strategies during the back-and-forth of the Activation Sequence.
- Have Fun : Quantum Nexus is a game meant to be enjoyed. Don't get discouraged by losses, and always remember to have fun while playing.

By following these tips and strategies, you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled Quantum Nexus player. Remember, practice, experimentation, and a willingness to learn are key to mastering this complex and rewarding game.

# XVI. Advanced Deck Building Strategies

(Original text of this section is largely retained as its advice on metagame, curve, sideboarding, and archetypes is conceptually applicable, though the specifics will adapt to the new rules).

Crafting a winning deck involves more than just throwing together powerful cards. Here's how to refine your deck-building prowess:

## A. Metagame Analysis and Tech Choices
Stay ahead of the curve by analyzing the current metagame—the popular decks and strategies in the Quantum Nexus community. Identify dominant trends and tailor your deck to counter them.
- Tech Choices : These are cards specifically included to address prevalent threats. They might not shine in every match, but they can be the difference-maker against certain decks.

## B. Curve Optimization
A well-balanced curve is crucial. It ensures you have plays available at various CP costs, allowing you to make effective use of your CP throughout the Activation Sequence of a Game Round. Aim for a smooth progression of card costs, allowing you to maintain pressure and options.

## C. Sideboarding
This is the art of fine-tuning your deck between games in a match. By swapping out specific cards, you can adapt your strategy to better counter your current opponent's deck.

## D. Deck Archetypes
Quantum Nexus offers various deck archetypes, each with distinct playstyles:
- Aggro : Overwhelm opponents with early aggression and efficient attacks.
- Control : Outlast opponents through disruption, defensive plays, and resource denial.
- Combo : Execute powerful combinations for devastating effects.
- Midrange : Strike a balance between aggression and control, adapting to the flow of the game.
Experiment with different archetypes to find the one that suits your playstyle and the current metagame shaped by the alternating activation system.

## E. Continuous Improvement
Deck building is an ongoing journey. The metagame evolves, new cards are released, and your understanding of the game deepens. Continuously test, refine, and adapt your deck based on your experiences and the ever-changing landscape of Quantum Nexus.
