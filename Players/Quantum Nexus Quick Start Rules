# **Quantum Nexus: Quick Start Guide**

## **I. Introduction**

Quantum Nexus is an exciting sci-fi trading card game where you command powerful armies and outsmart your opponent. Build a deck, deploy units, activate abilities, and conquer the battlefield!

**Objective:** **Defeat your opponent** by either:

*   Forcing them to draw a card when their deck is empty, or
*   Completing all of your mission cards.

## **II. Components**

*   **Cards:** The heart of the game. Units battle, Assets provide ongoing effects, Events offer powerful one-time abilities.
*   **Deck:** Your collection of cards, shuffled and drawn from during your turn.
*   **Discard Pile:** Where used and destroyed cards go.
*   **Loadout Area:** Specifically for Asset cards.
*   **Battlefield:** Divided into quadrants where you deploy units and battle.
*   **Mission Cards:** Your objectives, placed face-up at the start of the game.

## **III. Building Your Deck**

Before you start playing, you need to build a deck of cards. Here are some basic rules:

*   **Deck Size:** Your deck must contain exactly 200 Command Points (CP). Each card has a CP value in the top left corner.
*   **Mission Cards:** You can have up to six mission cards in your deck. These cards represent your objectives and might have special abilities. The sum of all domains cannot exceed 6.
*   **Unit Cards:** The domain values on your unit cards must match or be lower than the domain values on your mission cards. For example, if your mission cards have 3 points in Technology, your unit cards cannot have more than 3 points in Technology. 
*   **Duplicate Limits:** Some cards have limits on how many copies you can have in your deck. Make sure you follow these limits.

## **IV. Turn Structure**

Each turn has four phases. Players **alternate taking turns within each phase**. The player who goes first can usually be determined by a CP comparison of randomly drawn cards.

*   **Ready Phase (Simultaneous):** Both players deactivate cards, draw new cards, and reset their Command Points (CP).
*   **Deployment Phase (Alternating Turns):** Players take turns deploying units and terrain cards onto the battlefield, using their CP.
*   **Command Phase (Alternating Turns):** Activate card abilities and play Event cards.
*   **Battle Phase (Alternating Turns):** Declare attacks with your units, aiming to destroy your opponent's units.

**Initiative: Generally, the player who plays fewer cards in a phase goes first in the next phase.**

## **V. Card Types**

*   **Units:** Your warriors! Attack and Defense values determine their strength in battle. Deployed on the battlefield.
*   **Assets:** Provide support! No Attack value, but have Defense. Placed in your Loadout Area, offering persistent effects.
*   **Events:** Game-changers! Powerful one-time effects. Played during the Command Phase and then discarded.
*   **Upgrades:** Enhancements! Attach to other cards to boost their abilities or stats.
*   **Terrain:** Shape the battlefield! Deployed on the battlefield and affect units within specific quadrants.

**Some cards have abilities that activate when certain things happen in the game. Read your cards carefully!**

## **VI. Areas of Play**

The playing area is divided into zones:

*   **Deck:** Where you draw your cards from.
*   **Discard Pile:** Where used and destroyed cards go.
*   **Loadout Area:**  Where Asset cards are placed.
*   **Battlefield:** Where units are deployed and battles take place. The battlefield is divided into quadrants.

## **VII. Winning the Game**

**Win by either:**

*   **Emptying your opponent's deck:** If they can't draw a card, you win!
*   **Completing all your mission cards:** Achieve all your objectives to secure victory!

## **VIII. Basic Gameplay Example**

Alice and Bob are playing Quantum Nexus. Alice goes first.  Let's imagine a simplified round:

*   **Ready Phase:** Both players draw cards until they have five in hand. Alice starts with 18 CP, Bob with 16 CP.
*   **Deployment Phase:**
    *   Alice deploys a "Psionic Scout" unit (2 CP) to the Front Left quadrant. 
    *   Bob deploys a "Divine Acolyte" unit (3 CP) to the Front Right quadrant.
*   **Command Phase:**
    *   Alice activates her "Tech Turret" asset's ability, giving her units a bonus against Bob's "Divine Acolyte."
    *   Bob passes.
*   **Battle Phase:**
    *   Alice attacks and destroys Bob's "Divine Acolyte" with her "Psionic Scout."
    *   Bob passes.

This is a very simple example. In a full game, players would continue taking turns, deploying more units, activating abilities, and battling until one player wins!

## **IX. Important Tips**

*   **Command Points (CP) are valuable!** Think carefully about which cards you play and abilities you use each turn.
*   **Some cards allow you to draw more cards.** Having more cards in your hand gives you more options!
