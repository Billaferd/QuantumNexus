## VI. Basic Gameplay Example

Alice and Bob are playing Quantum Nexus. Alice goes first.

 * Ready Phase: Both players draw cards until they have five in hand. Alice starts with 18 CP, Bob with 16 CP.
 * Deployment Phase:
   * Alice deploys a "Psionic Scout" unit (2 CP) to the Front Left quadrant.
   * Bob deploys a "Divine Acolyte" unit (3 CP) to the Front Right quadrant.
 * Command Phase:
   * Alice activates her "Tech Turret" asset's ability, giving her units a bonus against Bob's "Divine Acolyte."
   * Bob passes.
 * Battle Phase:
   * Alice attacks and destroys Bob's "Divine Acolyte" with her "Psionic Scout."
   * Bob passes.

This is a simplified example. In a full game, players would continue taking turns, deploying more units, activating abilities, and battling until one player wins!
